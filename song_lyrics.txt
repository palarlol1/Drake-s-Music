cuz they know i know

and since drake done took it from curls to waves
its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
i mean i had my share of women
now a nigga gettin girls for days
with most of em its seemin like they world is staged
but from georgia to bk and all around the world
get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
if you've been hurt and you alone be steady

look theres requirements to be an admirer
still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra
so we can be jenny and swayze
i told you i'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
or maybe its karma
they say is a charmer
halfway to a night so i stay in a armor
i'm fire on the move
a tire looking smooth
i'm not perfect but i got a desire to improve
i'm special
like kids in a graduating class
having more trouble than others when addin basic math
need you to be special like areba to cootmore
double o, top secret agents with suits on
something so deep it da drown me
friends are some cool dudes
i vouch for the people around me
on your end its simple
all you have to do

[hook:]
stance on lean, leg up on the wall
my people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
i'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
you waiting for the spring, and i'm gettin it in the fall
but uh, do what you do what you, i do what i do
do's what you do, i do what i do

[verse 1:]
getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
a lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
a lot of records from here they get no play
and these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
them little rims on the ride, i'mma let those stay
so these nosy niggas won't know that i get checks all day
'whats he worth?' fans keep trying on guessing
my record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
boi-1da and drake if there's beef i address it
and the black phantom is here soon as we find our exit
both of the deals, nothing under a mill
we know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
long as i got me some heat through the winter
drake known as a pro, i'mma teach you beginners
bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
for features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner
cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
if you see her tell this nigga got some beats i'mma sell her

[hook x2]

[verse 2:]
check, the verses i'm writing you might wanna learn it
you hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
so now you at the store for some blank cds
you can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
and i'll be the only one she concerned with
to the people that ignored me before this
this one is for you as a song re-recorded
funny thing is, you just notice me now
but i was here along your vision's just been distorted
i'm so throwed, [?] and i write a sixteen and record it
the waiting is over i think music need it
drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
people in the south want it chopped and screwed, i got this dude
they expectations i'mma exceed it
like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
when it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
finally here i'mma star with the timing
my swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
this for anybody that's searchin for cash
and purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin
and so i grind like i'm listening to all wayne
my pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy

[hook x2]

[verse 3:]
two years ago, a friend of mine
asked me to kick some new school lines
and so i sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
now not signing me is something that the rest regret
then i, hopped inside the cadillac
the chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[hook]


[talking:]
southern smoke {echo}
it's southern smoke baby!
(money) frank [?]
(money) my man nickelus f
(money) ho! it's drake. southern smoke
(money) this is the remix right here
(money) so if you got some (money)

(money) southern smoke

[verse 1:]
now-a-days you sayin' that i should go jermaine, i should go pharrell
either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(right) make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
so you could get checks cut like benedict in ocean's twelve
this ain't brad pitt, i gotta admit
i'm sick of seeing chicks in that louis v and that plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
they say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
i know my cash come quick when it's sunny
you know a girl is special if i stick with her honey
if it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
and if it wasn't for money nick would still have skummy
so, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
to jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
if you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
a week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[chorus:]
i, take time arrange that (money)
some, kill just to claim that (money)
switch countries exchange that (money)
you cannot get jack for freeee

and my, proceeds and cash right (money)
there's, no need to stash right (money)

[?]

[chorus:]

maybe they can bring they career back
but these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that

[verse 1]
this the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
back back, southern town fans get to tippin
chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
i don't back track, every single sound for me different
i don't own no ice, just got clean rap
don't ever two step, i just rock, lean, snap
we could take it out to houston where the rides all glossed up
anybody i'm standin beside's all bossed up
burgular ? they say i'm servin them rhymers
and me and nickel f go together like burgers and diners, yes
i'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
with trays in both hands, place an order i can cater uh
i got the diamonds in my teeth flow
memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
peep though, i only got pity for you lames
sitting pretty in the game, in the city that i claim

[chorus]
yo, the city is mine (which one?)
t-o-r-o-n-t-o
d-r-a-k-e that's me
you know how the story goes

girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it

[verse 2]
break it down like you working for your tuition at howard
mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
so if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
and if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
and it's a trip, my city broke into sections
up north i got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
and it's nothing that i created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
but they scared to let it surface, uh
ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
see me out and they never utter a word to 'em
expect me not to draw a card from the deck
anybody in my city going hard i respect but,
you gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
it ain't a problem of concern bruh, i always end up with exactly what i earn bruh
this ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
yessir, i live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
and, i be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
and i got way too much love, for the city i can never get too much of
and if anybody hatin on me, i deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[chorus]
yo, the city is mine (which one?)
t-o-r-o-n-t-o
d-r-a-k-e that's me
you know how the story goes
pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
and i play myself in the stereo

[slakah:]
lady, you say i stay in the house til four
we dont even go out no more
its always the same eh
always complainin
its obvious baby
i guess you dont watch the news
you see theres a lot to lose
cuz we got a baby
and people are shady

[bridge: drake]
my generation is changin
aside from the fact
the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
front of the buses taken
and we denied from the back
you can die where from, or die where you at

[drake chorus]
don't put it past them
i dont think that they understood
my friends they dont even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[slakah:]
lady, somebody shot up the place right by
where i work and i think they might
be coming for me next
lend me ya kleenex
i'm tellin you baby
i think i'm a bout to cry
still gotta go out tonight
cuz i gotta feed you
i hope that i see you again... again
hope that i see you, see you

[chorus: drake]
don't put it past them
i dont think that they understood
my friends they dont even sit in the class when they should
he can come pick you up
if your dads in the hood
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[verse: drake]
lately i dont know about the friends that i hang with
im nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
with dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
depends on what they do to achieve that
robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
'specially if they know where they girl live
get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is

thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
streets are seedy i call em sesame... berkstown
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
next week same place'll get burnt down
coincidink? not likely not a chance
how can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
at least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
a lot of people only play they part when they spittin
but i dont think that they understood
they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes im glad that keenan could
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good


[chorus:]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone [x2]

[verse 1: drake]
look,
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
rappers they tend to be smilin
because they swimmin in women
most of em sick of favors
they come in secret flavors
thats why i envy omar
because so far

and thats some higher learning
trying ta excel with the brake on
i'll have you stuck in the same spot
with the tires burnin
and im a liar turnin 19, jaded with no faith
in any female thats askin what i was earnin
i met this recent lady
she knew a piece of sadey by spinners
i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
cuz she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now im out of both and i've been thinkin of aleshia lately
im all alone, i got a feelin its on
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh

[chorus:]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

[verse 2: drake]
some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces
circling workplaces
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
they get to first bases
then they get to retreating cuz if she cheatin
he wanna know what the first trace is
now you like macgyver
cuz you sneakin around
and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
i cant relate to that
i had to take it back a couple a years
when some of the best kicked it with drake in fact

i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it
with [?] and they lewis and a couple things that they true in
and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do
cuz its my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
and i used to be eager to buy em the world
maybe im confused about what i desire from girls
either way im all alone, got a feelin its on
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[chorus:]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone

[verse 3: drake]
check,
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
since i aint made them a purchase yet
but theres logic behind it
emotions double and they try to cover up
like a mansion with the projects behind it
i tend to freak with this
i get a girl and pretend that i love the spendin
and all she gave was a decent kiss
thinkin she been spoiled
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
and come up with tin foil

we could dissect it see
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
gave her nothing
her reputations in jeopardy
cuz it aint take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick that'll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
for thinkin that exists, i got a feeling im wrong
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh

[chorus:]
loves lost
loves gone
love lost
love is gone


[chorus:]
look,
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience
(you're worth so much more)
to my dudes at the bar with a freak and
steady lightin cigars at the parties they sneak in
and look forward to being a star on the weekend
ya are part of the speech coz

[verse 1: drake]
im from the city where people be gettin lazy
litterin in the streets
and the club district is poppin like literally every week
and promoters'll push flyers
money exchange hands
liars sell you they dreams
and dummies exchange plans
hustlers give you events
bouncers give you pass
directors give em a shot
so girls'll give up the ass

and groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs
til the dude catch a plane
and she back where she was
right back on the bus
its ashame cuz now at his rental
she throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch
you can see thats shes colder
cuz he doesnt hold her
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
know that he tried ta told her
that he couldnt mold her
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, i say

[chorus:]
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
i ask you to have some patience

ya are part of the speech coz

[verse 2: drake]
now up north theres five artists deservin a listen
and im one of em, the other four you know who you are
but if you gotta think through
chances are that it aint you
i singlehandedly carry out what you cant do
and see i take a couple of breathers
and then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
if you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
go ahead, i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
but uh, the in & the out
[?]
whenever im out in memphis the man seen as trill
and every verse the man seem to kill
you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill
japan and brazil, the audience acreaming
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
advances to deals, financing appeals
the hustles, i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[chorus:]
if you a girl with the aspirations
of being in the background witcha asses shakin

ya are part of the speech coz


[drake: talking]
uh, yea, get in my slick rick mode
n'a mean?, im a tell ya a story real quick

[verse 1: drake]
look,
she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
crib was 2 mil, plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
even if the house was ten grand
and there was no pool
would i still be witout my swim fan?
the ceiling could be higher
she making requests
dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
and purses are light now
she use em all the time
so she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
and she simply a new model
stay spendin dollars
but she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
at times she a solid chick
and im a sucka for the cuties
so she always lookin good when my wallets thick
chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
want the diamonds on the face in the center
nice guys finish last so im winnin every race that i enter and she a

[chorus:]
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same

and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[verse 2: drake]
you're all the same
look at vida guerrera
theres no need to compare her
i bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
i bet shes out meetin directors instead
and frustratrated cuz shes already been addressed in they head
be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and i'll bet you that they'll sign
if you a real dime
poppin as if its your only option
girl theres things to do
other than jail time
look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
i just give my opinion for laughter
or maybe to think on
so next time you out at the club
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
and as ya man i wont back down first
but they got you doing soft-core background work
that messed up like an officer that pulls you over
and he ask questions later and pat down first
but you aint thandie newton, and this aint crash here
the resolutions passed baby, this aint last year
look, i got a message, i'll say it
i got some beats still
regina hall and garcelle and alice neal
young girls these here women with big dreams
role models that you can watch on the big screen
if you refuse to change and you that chick still
respect yourself, dont be convinced that these tricks will
you got an audience believe it or not
my cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill

[chorus:]
video girl
eh yo you have to listen
im in a bad position
i fell in love with a
video girl
i wouldnt call her name
i got the feelin that they all the same
and she a
video girl
to the fullest extent
so i wrote you a song
cuz i cant stay with a
video girl
and you betrayed your wealth
got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[drake: speaking]
and i aint trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself
you know as a person man. i love to see my black women strong, single,
independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, dont hate me for
this one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh,
if she beautiful and honey dances
and you always downtown making money transfers
and anything the color of braces she get excited
she always showing up at these places she get invited
she a video girl


[talking:]
yeah, this dedicated to canada man
the whole up north
a lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter
but listen...

[verse 1:]
i met this new girl late june or early july
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now it's december, i'm driving, and she's like where's my hi?
i swear, that i never called you cause i really get shy
see that was a segue, i believe the matter
is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up
where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in
the winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
and some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties!

[talking: over chorus]
yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
but just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[verse 2:]
forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet
since i'm driving, i ask her how to get the suite
she doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
she's bold but i roll with it, i'm impressed cause she's sweet
then she says "i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat,
i mean, the lyrics are good, but i'm obsessed with the beat
i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good,
there's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat"
off this i'm kinda takin it back for a second,
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
until we end up sexin and now my heart attached
i'm thinkin off i should've been more southern
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho!

[talking: over chorus]
yeah, uh, i told ya'll i had a story for you right
uh, ya man, it's what it is

[verse 3:]
and now, i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but, my boy say i'm actin different, because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
she tellin everyone imma hold here down
tell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town
and stupid me i just listen to her,
instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna
and it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
i guess, i lost another one to the wintertime

[voice + (drake):]
i miss you, most of aaaallll, myy daarling [beat fades out]
(gimme a second to gather my toughts)
[fades back in] strolling in the park (ho!)
and watching winter turn to spriing (such a beautiful day man)
(yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
(i'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
(man, but i got something to else to tell ya baby)

[rap:]
i remember them encore pms, breakfast and the wake up
now drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
so we can get back to them cognac nights
with dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
the winter came and blew his cold air through
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her,
by the end of the week i would know that crew
and we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had ladie's hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different it's a two man operation
granted the fact that we one man short
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
cause handin' them crack is a one man sport
instead of dress-up, i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin'
i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
the face, the breast, the bras, the toes
i'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
we'll never talk again, scary and true
that song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified
it's what i'm lookin for to carry me through
yet i can't seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
and when they talk about they past and lovers
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
there's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive

[voice:]
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing
strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing


southern smoke!!!

[speaking]
yeah. ho! 
it's drake. uh uh. ho!
do that dance. do that dance

[chorus:]
you special girl, don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so, at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[verse 1:]
look i ought to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love
and when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex
somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck
or maybe before, i'm here waiting to score
it's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
instead these girls taking it raw,
now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more 
wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
so they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie
but once they have my pants and my khakis
i tell them i'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
because, i hate waking up undressed with a dame
and guessing her name, i hope this shit is destined to change

[chorus: (x2)]
because you special girl, don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby
so, at least i know where the ones at
baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

[verse 2:]
i don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
it's like i meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
it's something that i can rarely predict
all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict
i'm guessing maybe shemar moore isn't really all pure
maybe i lie to myself and it's like a small cure
i tell it all to her
i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
because really, what is a window without a car door?
why i can't settle for one instead of all four?
mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
jason tell me i'ma have a baby by next year
psychic told me i'ma have three kids
i don't want my daughter making a song like teairra mari did
so, i'ma change yeah this summer is gone
i'm running along, before i raise one of my own

[chorus: (x2)]
because you special girl, don't leave me baby
to find another just like you won't be easy baby

[intro: voyce]

this another one from your boy v-o
i'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

[chorus: voyce]
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!!
i can't believe that it's just really you and me, and i know
i can't contain myself, all this love (loving me)!!

[verse 1: voyce]
girl, i've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
and i want to know, if you feel the same way!!
because i'm in and out of town, that's just how i got's to get down
but you understand, that's why i'm your man!!

[chorus: voyce]
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!!
i can't believe that it's just really you and me, and i know

uh, uh, uh (you want me to drop to this beat?)
uh, uh, uh (ho!)
yeah yeah (let me get a little gospel on them. yeah. uh)

[verse 2: drake]
they say he wanted the bounce back
i can make them easily admit that the bounce back
without knowing exactly where me accounts at
yeah, you best believe
that i often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
so, they don't like me
they throw parties, and yet they never invite me
i can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
either way the true fans yell
i appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
and no, this ain't blu cantrell
this is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
couple things i do damn well,
and the way that i jack son, you figure drake knew sam. l (samuel jackson)
i'm for real though
i'm from memphis, i'm often labeled as trill so
they stay kicking it with me like a field goal
see i'm humble, but i live fame
for more deals on the table than abridge game. ahh

[chorus: voyce]
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!!
i can't believe that it's just really you and me, and i know
i can't explain myself, all this love (loving me)!!

[bridge: voyce]
even when the sun don't shine, i know you're my sunshine
and even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
i need to feel you next to me, you want to feel me next to you
we can do anything you want to do
tell me the next morn baby!!!

[chorus: voyce]
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!!
i can't believe that it's just really you and me, and i know
i can't contain myself, all this love (loving me)!!


[nickelus f: speaking]
niggas in the city hatin' me man they trippin'
when i'm the only one that's really spittin'
my nigga lil lee the only one that's really grippin'
why you deck(?) me up actin' like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?

uh, i'm bringing back hip hop
me and my nigga drake
va, toronto, hip-hop

[verse: nickelus f] 
aiight let me take my jacket off
unlace the timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
this time i'm blabbin on 
these rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
i got the gift like santa claus
flow got spring like a catapult
matter fact the flow supreme like diana ross
i'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
niggas acting like scummy was they neega(?)
wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
i know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
i said nah lets keep it peaceful
my nigga was a true weed source
he gave it to us for a cheap cost, for prices we all could eat off
a real street dog
the type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
we have an impostor, alert the doctor
bout to hit him up with the chopper like blaka
shock em like blanca from street fighter, heat got a
hurricane kick, murder everything quick
look, my new ryu nine is stupendous
why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
my crew lie you guys into ditches
i said it and meant it the scorpio's mind has many dimensions
i'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
hope your listenin to my diction
if you are then you now should be itchin
that its crack we placed in your stereo system
yea, i be at your burial trippin
nickelus f from richmond
va, 
the scorpio's mind is not a game to play wit all day

[verse: drake]
i've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
disliked by some, but confronted by none
since they don't show me sincerity, i load up, lock up
take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody
but compared to d
they one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
if that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be
you got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
and when the psychic get to touchin my palm
seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
cause i'm harnessin a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
to play around, to perfection i'm the spittin image
my verbal camp is vivid, i told you i'm spittin image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova, and those of you feelin hova
and writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over
let me assist you like a specialist
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
it's not a problem wit x, i guess i'm a pessimist
which means if shit goes bad, i say "i expected this"
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
instead of understanding its a tune of hate
the city's mine like oklahoma's a sooner state
and we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
you aint morris chestnut, you lighter and less cut
and lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
you still a protege, that's the reason i don't holler
you got rappers being repetitive actors
you stay ahead of the game, i'm ahead of the practice boi


southern smoke!!!

[intro: drake talking]
yeah. ren. m.o.f. haha. 
it's drake man. it's drake man.yeah
ayo ren this that gritty shit here man
i'ma half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean
ho!  southern smoke!!!

[verse 1: drake]
very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
the samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
i'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
my father's early careering forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doing what he was doing before us
because money is an issue, your son he gon miss you
and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
now you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this
you end up doing time, and me i end up with a step-sis
nobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you, i'd be a wasn't
and mommy i'ma support her, i keep it all in order
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border 
but

[chorus: nickelus f]
i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
it's stress my nigga!!!
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!

[verse 2: drake]
this is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what i been through
i write a verse addressing it, and yes i might offend you
picture when i was in school,
me being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered, i never liked to fight
but when someone called me a "nigger" i'd punch them i couldn't help it
now i'm grown i can say what it is
it's parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids
and your daddy want it very right
i make you happy, plus i'm jewish, he don't approve, i think he want you to marry white
he want sinatra at the wedding, not barry white
because black is black honey, even if he's very light
and so i never been for dinner at they places
always brutally honest, and so i pin it to they faces
i live it so the case is, whether drake is
way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

[chorus: nickelus f]
i got stress on my shoulders
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
it's stress my nigga!!!
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo!

[verse 3: drake]
am i hot as the rest, should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double d's, i gotta lot on my chest
there's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
instead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts
and yes, when i'm dismissed after a tedious listen
i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician 
homie, i probably could of been on tv consistent
an artist like pablo, or maybe petey's assistant 
and my mindset is come and get me
i'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me
so, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson
nigga get the handgun
if not, you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
that have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
last couple of months i done probably been
around the world and back, and i don't wanna question half the places nick been

[chorus: nickelus f (drake ad-libs)]
i got stress on my shoulders (uh!)
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (yeah!)
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (oh!)
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (yeah man!)
it's stress my nigga!!!
i'm just trying to live my life cuz
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo! (this that gritty shit boy)
i'm just trying to live my life cuz (got me winded over here man)
make a little money, find a bunny
to make my wife cuz bo!, bo!, bo!, bo! (uh)


[verse 1:]
sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what i'm about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
and they try to make you out as a lie
symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
it's a lose lose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics 
and the motives to try and make them a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
niggas wanna say that you ain't around
i mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town

[chorus: (x4)]
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try try-try-try

[verse 2:]
and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' is fresher 
than most of these rappers running the game
concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash
there's time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range, also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent
sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers
and watched the game from the bleachers
because i'm really tend to need what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
i wasted late out at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner i'm working hard on the winner 
so this album is a labor of love
you say as long as i'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats 
that she can rest without a toss and a turn
because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv
that's exactly why i often get burned
but i'm gonna try to..

[chorus: (x4)]
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try try-try-try


[lupe fiasco: talking]
uh, what up y'all!
soundtrack what's popping baby?
y'all ain't know, i go by the name of lupe fiasco
representing that first and fifteen
jyea, uh!
and this one right here
i dedicate this one right here
to all my homies out there grinding
you know what i'm saying?
legally and illegally
hahaha...
you know what i'm talking about?
so, check it out

[verse 1: lupe fiasco]
first got it when he was six
didn't know any tricks
matter of fact first time he got on it he slipped
landed on his hip
and bust his lip
for a week he had to talk with a lisp
like thisssss
now we can end the story right here
but shorty didn't quit there was something in the air
yea, he said it was something so appealing
he couldn't fight the feeling
something about it
he knew he couldn't doubt it
couldn't understand it
brand it, just the first kickflip he land it
uh, labeled a misfit, a bandit
kakunk kakunk kakunk!
his neighbors couldn't stand it so
he was banished to the park
started in the morning wouldn't stop 'til after dark
yea, when they said, "it's getting late in here..
...so i'm sorry young man there's no skating here"

[chorus]
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast

[verse 2: drake]
(waddup lupe, chi town!)
my style is very tennessee
mixed with some terry kennedy
people barley remember me from back in the day
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
but check it gets boring growing up in memphis
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
luckly my aunt working as a nurse
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus she'd always give me speeches on the first
if i 'm staying in her house then i need to get some work
i tell her i was there on vacation
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey he's waiting
so now its me and old school
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
he knew i didn't really wanna post here
open up the window told me that the coast clear
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
homie this is recess east test
life's ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes i'm literly landel lewis with a kick and a snare
kick flip in the air
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
just so the space ain't restricted in here
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
cousins at the door like ri mi fa so
i say aunty this is a safe career
she said drake i told you there's no skating here

[chorus:]
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast

[verse 3: lupe fiasco]
before he knew he had a crew
that wasn't no punk
and they spitfire shirts
and sb dunks
they would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
and it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
any escape route they used to escape out
when things got crazy
they needed to break out
they head to any place with stairs
any good grinds
the world was theirs
uh, and their four wheels would take them there
until the cops came and said, "there's no skating here"

[chorus:]
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
and away he rolled
just a rebel to the world with no place to go
and so he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, coast
so come and skate with me
just a rebel
looking for a place to be
so let's kick... and push... and coast

[verse 1: drake]
mr. big dreams no tolerance

he stay grown
so the p-a-trãn had to get poured quickly
ex girl strippin'
i can't stop her
new girl trippin' but i can't drop her
'cause i need somethin' to balance out the fact
that it's hard to find a woman when you' talented and black
when you hollerin' at labels
and they silencing you back
'cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
well
gunshot for the young yacht owner
see there's everybody else then there's one top loner
first place is often the worst place
but fuck it i love it here i call it my birthplace
whenever i walk in they makin' the worst face
surrounded by fillipinos i think of the worst case
watch blue and green diamonds i call it the earth face
i'm gettin' ya cake i tell you how ya dessert taste
i get a dessert plate
y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
i've been urkel for some years it's better bein' jaleel
though i rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
it's better drivin' a car with the letter b in the wheel
seat back
light sayin' tank on e
i got the drank on me
you better bank on me
to be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
in the club with a model spillin' drinks on me

the city is mine
i know it because i'm there y'all
it ain't even started i'm really tryna prepare y'all
spring '07 second quarter i'm droppin'
with or without a label man i'm committed to poppin'
and take over the summer
tour to tour hoppin'
i'mma meet a lot of women i'mma do a lot of shoppin'
really no other option
spend a lot of money just to make it back
anybody i dissed in a song i don't take it back
same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' drake is wack
are checkin' my availability just to make a track
i promise mama
i'mma do it 'cause i know i put you through it (i know i put you through it baby)
and i just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table 
and say "my baby's famous and i knooow it" (yeah)
and it wasn't nothin' tooo it
i've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
the ballpoint run out
then all joints come out classic
rappers are fake we can all point one out

[drake talking]
yeah
i'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the atf (uhh)
miss andreena mill

[chorus: andreena mill]
closer to my dreams i'm gettin' higher
yeah i feel it in my sleep
i said i'm gettin' higher
yeah
and closer to my dreams
whoa
sometimes it feels like i'll never move on
closer to my dreams

[verse 2: drake]
look
i took a plane to hawaii with d
and we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
from meetin' trey in atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video 
which made everything right with x (songz)
i got too many records and not enough shows
for too many rappers and not enough __
well
you can fill the blank in
they tryna be the best
just tryna place in the rankin'
day care play pen drop out
to grade ten drop out
to summer '05 with the grey benz drop out
charcoal charger
racin' through back streets
on my (craig david) shit the (artful dodger)
shola ama
i told her i'mma
'bout to get my run on so hold the commas
times've changed now i'm older mama
and these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
and that's the realest shit i ever wrote
a compilation of mental thoughts that i never note
and hi, haters
i'm back off of hiatus

i'm gettin' cake off of my latest
anticipated like the iphone
respected in any city that i roam
summertime

home

[outro: drake talking]
yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(sing it to' em 'dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
i want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man

[chorus]


[echo-trey songz]
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[verse 1-drake]
lat me show what it is
i was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like
[trey]
ooo wee
[drake]

[drake]
this metaphore might sound a little confusing but
[trey]

i took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now i say it's sittin at amazing'
girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us 
hear em all screamin then it's probably is
but i can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
what you really expect when i strut through town
two or three days i shut you down
chilin wit the homie trey songz
you call him the prince he rep two up two down
anyone i know get used to me
im far from the man that i used to be 
i don't ever really kick game
i know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
'cause i'm a good dude who take pride in that
need good lovin' i'm providing that
understand that i'm worldwide
you get who you want it wherever you be residing at
'cause i do things from the m-town
to the uk
from spain back out to texas
this album's for my fans
but yo this hook is for my exes

[chorus-trey songz]
this one is for you girl
you know who you are girl
you only show you're face
'cause you know that i'm a star girl
what you trying to to make it
don't ever mistake it
'cause my time is limited and i ain't trying to waste it all on you 
you had a chance now it's gone
oooooh

[chorus]

[verse 3-drake]
check this out
from the that she get picked for some take out
until they slip up and break out
but it's another story over here at drake's house
'cause i'm dripped up and i'm drapped out
and i'm lean back
scoping
looking for a woman that i should wife
who got just the right amount of loyalty
yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
we go la, va
ny, to
sunshine in that heat stroke
and them fur hoods in that deep snow
we have breakfast in the bedroom
break bread downstairs in the basement
since jay and kelz ain't doing the thing no more
guess me and the boy songz is the replacement

[chorus]

ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
ay, ay, ay
let's go


[verse 1]
this the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin
back back, southern town fans get to tippin
chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission
i don't back track, every single sound for me different
i don't own no ice, just got clean rap
don't ever two step, i just rock, lean, snap
we could take it out to houston where the rides all glossed up
anybody i'm standin beside's all bossed up
burgular ? they say i'm servin them rhymers
and me and nickel f go together like burgers and diners, yes
i'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
with trays in both hands, place an order i can cater uh
i got the diamonds in my teeth flow
memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow
peep though, i only got pity for you lames
sitting pretty in the game, in the city that i claim

[chorus]
yo, the city is mine (which one?)
t-o-r-o-n-t-o
d-r-a-k-e that's me
you know how the story goes
pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
and i play myself in the stereo
and i make 'em wanna 
shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[verse 2]
break it down like you working for your tuition at howard
mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
so if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
and if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
and it's a trip, my city broke into sections
up north i got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
and it's nothing that i created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem
but they scared to let it surface, uh
ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
see me out and they never utter a word to 'em
expect me not to draw a card from the deck
anybody in my city going hard i respect but,
you gotta debt and you choose not to pay that
imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
it ain't a problem of concern bruh, i always end up with exactly what i earn bruh
this ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
yessir, i live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
and, i be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
and i got way too much love, for the city i can never get too much of
and if anybody hatin on me, i deport 'em, the city is mine boy

[chorus]
yo, the city is mine (which one?)
t-o-r-o-n-t-o
d-r-a-k-e that's me
you know how the story goes
pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
and i play myself in the stereo
and i make 'em wanna 
shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
shake shake it, drop it drop it, bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

break it down, break it break it down
break it down, break it break it down
break it down, break it break it down
break it down, break it break it down
break it down


yeah look
it's what you all been waiting for ain't it?
your weekly entertainment
for me to get a hold of this beat
and go ahead claim it
i'm about to paint a picture
you niggas go 'head frame it
'cause we getting seinfeld
on some jerry and elaine shit
i flow far from mediocre
and if we talking cards
i will fold 'em with the poker
you and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
so it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers (unh)
and me i'm rolling with some brokers
like damn, could you niggas get any broker
got my new girl so content
just save yourself the embarrassment
don't even approach her
disguise yourself, go buy a costume
i am making stocks work while you working stock room (unh)
and i was praying i would drop june but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
so i keep it rockin' for pete's sake
you fake gangsta rappers are cliché
and if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake
i be in your face like "no speaka la englis"
soon as you hear it, you quote it
they tryna be the one that i done left out the show with
but trust me i'm aware and my car's right there
is this interior enough for your ulterior motives
'cause if you like it you should stick with me
my money good i ain't ever had to flip a key
a lot of ice a lot of cream like dicky d
might cut the phone and disappear like mishy me
but i'm tryna have you on that trip with me
sliding through henri bendel like it's slippery
and your ex-man is a hater, officially
probably 'cause he know i'm exactly what you wish he'd be
yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'cause i done snatched the chips ahoy out his cookie jar
he just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a michael jordan rookie card
let me address this, pardon me while i fix
couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
i guess he thought he could've been gotti in the flicks
but at this point i'm just poking her body with a stick
nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
and girl's keep telling me i'm still as snobby
i tell 'em myself who i am feeling probably
just because i got a buzz like a building lobby
it ain't a song that your ass finna skip
i tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
the way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
seems like she don't really need no gas for the trip
millionaire shades, fade with waves, i smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids,
that just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except trey
ay, i'm outta here baby
they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
i wouldn't take it back, nah, not if you paid me
mister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a fugayze
spittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy
the shit is so nasty, how is it tasting
and you can probably find him walking out of a macy's
forget a girl, they just thinking how to replace me
exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
he took that
'ye beat and you put that shit in a choke,
well, i think that i should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents,
i ain't tryna leave you broke
life of a don, lights keep glowing,
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm, (arm),
and here's another hit, barry bonds'


i'on think they really ready for my wardrobe
i show up right before the store close
and blow the fee from my last four shows
i do one song and use four flows
she use to be a christian before...
but now all she wanna do is shop for christian dior clothes,
like baby those are cute i adore those
me and the salesman build a rapport so
he understands tha fact that i'm spending off shore dough
cash only transactions, homie,
and please no receipts the feds like to explore those
they can't audit if they don't know i bought it
i been doin' this for years homie, thoroughly i've thought it
through, what it do, i am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currency's imported
we're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with
lawsuits even if they're crimes that i did commit
repeat offender, anita baker, playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
i got a jewish lawyer as my lead defender
a mitchkeit as they say he's a legal bender
and atf is present every legal memeber
the coalition, we so efficient
you have to be invited or there's no admission
we know tradition
we spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
i wish you would listen,
i take you back to this trial
where i am about to be home again like new edition
my foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in
used to record in a basement that rennie grew was piffin'
when pops turned over keys like a new ignition
if hov is jordan, i guess i'm cool with pippen
'til i mention that i wanna play a new position
no team playin', no screen settin'
because i wanna win games, coach i'm through assistin'
the take over, the break's over, nigga
and i'm a keep killin' em until the day that drake's over
the wait's over, the tape's coming
they bullshittin' but i am equipped with great plumbing
the human mentality's so eager to hate something
i try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
and this the predicament that you found drake in
the condo that i just purchased sound vacant
'cause i have just been sittin' in this cell
thinkin' what i coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
and whenever i'm flowing on the mic,
aside from talkin' 'bout the d i'm throwin' in ya' wife
i treat this one session as if it was my last
and i pretend tomorrow is the day i'm going in for life, like that...


ok there comes a time when you gotta be like
you know i've come this far on my own
done a lot for myself
where to now ya know
but i just tell myself this one thing

it was worth it it was all worth it
and by this time i understand that i ain't perfect
there ain't a pair of louis shoes i ain't purchased
and i was on some shit but they served they purpose
and i got verses i got verses
my 16's should be arriving in hearses
they get bodied you see how i murk this
i switch flows much as my girl switch purses
yeah heartbreak drake i'll put it on your wife
if i put it in a verse then i put it on my life
liquor that's over ice and denim that's over priced
and tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
got got got got damn how time soars
i'm tryna get that house in toronto with pine floors
come over watch a season of flight of the concords
and i try to put some lotion all over your contours
but uh tell me you surfin let me know you on board
you can't seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
yes i swear to god girl i put it on lord
i'm tryna show you life through the tint on these tom ford's
ethiopian girl ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
reading all them pro black pro female books
just let em let em know that you ain't no groupie
you need a prescription a vision correction
i'm young and successful i'm living perfection
and man if 09 is when i'm a see mine
being cool ain't enough homie i'm a freeze time like that


[chorus]
take what you want, take what you wa-ah-aha-ant 
take what you want, take what you want
but, you gotta share it with the world 
[x3]

lately i've been murdering and avoiding conviction
this shit is like an addiction conflicting with what i do
shout out to k davis and my connect up at avis
'cause every weekend i'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
fortunately i am at an elevated level
i'm celebrated at home and i am high above it all
but apologies to my fans that be super conscious
just wait 'til i get my money right and i am going to ball
ball ball

[chorus]


[verse 1: drake]

previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
you could say i was fresh to some conceited degree
steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
but now i need a culprit
i am talkin long sands beach, condo adult shit
i am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
friends that i ball with
hear me trey's girl go and get you some fall shit
sweetie i am a track's demise
i will kill this song 'til it actually dies
with a military jacket and some packed supplies
i won't say i'm the best 'til the stats arrive
and all these a-list parties you fraternize
where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
bu you don't never act surprised
you just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
and girl, i used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
now it cost a couple thousand for a drake joint
i gave up a lot to make a progress
i give it to you, and you take it the best

[chorus: trey songz]
when i give ya what i give ya
(you gon' like that)
when i give ya what i give ya
(you throw it right back)
it ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
i need a women not a girl 'cause i'm bout that (oh no no)
and when i give ya what i give ya
(you gon' like that)
when i give ya what i give ya
(you throw it right back)
it ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
i need a women not a girl 'cause i'm bout that (oh no no)
and when i give ya what i give ya

[verse 2: trey songz]

but back to the pimpin' nigga

drake take patrãn to the face 'til he wasted
i'm blowin 'til i'm gon' outta space in the matrix

[chorus]


[chorus: dwele]
don't you have a man? (don't you got a man?)
why are you trying to be my girl?
i can't believe it
don't you have a man? (don't you got a man?)
it's alllll-right with me, my girl
we can do anything

[drake:]
why you over there lookin at me?
why your man stand-in right beside ya?
the temporary happiness he might provide ya
but you know and i know, that nobody gon do ya like me
tryna say you like a goalie in line of sight
i know that i feel a bit slowly, i'm kinda like,
"i'on't really wanna hit this girl"
and so she want this chef stick like napoleon dynamite
well, i'ma give it to you, honeybunches
you feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
all my other girls all up on that subtle shit
they don't wanna cut it, they wanna wrap it and cuddle with
consequences keep weighin me down
so whenever she thinks i'm serious, i'm playin around
it gets deeper and cold-er, the funny thing is
i'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...

[chorus]

[rapper big pooh:]
look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
you some (getback) for your man mistreat thing
but that was then, you know some hush-hush
i ain't never really see a future in us
plus your man still there, let's be fair
you'll do the same things to me
my feelings never did go past, some late night smash
i'on't wanna take the place of he!
late night's 85 south on my way to the crib
and somebody got a song for me
i already know what you about, cause i been the other man
and you not gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan

but i'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
i'm sayin, you need to do what you do
i'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon

[chorus]

[phonte:]
uh...uh...i met her at the bar sippin on patron
and now it's been three years off and on
cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
cause when i'm in, she out, and when she in, i'm gone (c'mon)
we lost contact like ? shalom
but regained it while she was buildin her house a home
wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
it just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
and wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
one minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
and i'm in her body like grey's anatomy
i don't understand why god sent me to you
and i cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
all i know is that each time i'm stickin you
i think to myself, "damn, if only her nigga knew", what?
[chuckles] yeah..

[chorus]

[outro: dwele]
don't you have a man? (don't you got a man?)

[chorus: andreena mill]
i gotta make it out, or move quickly
can't allow the past to restrict me
bet this time around they won't skip me
i am the last hope
don't hesitate not even for a second
the hustle has become an obsession
i'm on the front lines with my weapon
i am the last hope

[verse 1: kardinall offishall]
can you i-magine the last breath of christ?
the last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night
the last step that martin luther took as a man
i got the power of my world in my hand
the microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye
i was born to provoke those born to die
i was conceived to beat all odds like las vegas
t-dot motherfucker watch the world rape us
greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
cross border smugglers tussle to burn weed
it means that pressure of success in the south
niggas watchin' what i say magnifying my mouth
i never take back talk i apply the force
hand blistering from many years of holdin' the torch
when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather
so we can keep on holdin' it forever
my names kardinall

[chorus]

[verse 2: drake]
jealousy's suttin i haven't felt for years
there's nobody around for me to be jealous of
i bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove
i'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable
and when it comes to records 
i will eat it if it's edible
they say the futures always foreseen
that's why i'm steady getting more money, more cream
my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
i stay avoiding unlucky like 14
and people get behind 'im and they fight for 'im 
'cause he wont let no other niggas write for 'im
and even when it's quite warm
the attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm
the name drake and i don't take it for granted
i just take it you offended 'cause i'm taking advantage mayne

[chorus]


[intro]
i've got it made thats what i'm talking about
goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
so me and my lady can riiiide

check
i wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school
backpack grey range black ac'
coulda had the stack out just to get a stack back
double that school dance
fresh jakes new pants

it started out a boy like hugh grant
now i'm a young man doin things you can't


i swear to lord, same dudes use to laugh at me
see me in the cl6 with half a bead
they know that money begets money so naturally,
me, i have to blow a couple stacks, hassle free
i'm like fuck ya'll haters on behalf of me
cause i could flood the city with a staff of three
i'm talkin me and two partners in that caprice
with no copies made, i got the master keys
and fast cars, fast women, fast cash, and c.r.e.a.m
commode you rappers like plasticine
i have the dream, but dawg, me and success are two things you don't wanna find yo ass between
back against the wall like plasma screens
the inside of my wallet is pastured green
and you are now hangin with the asthma team
sweetie catch your breath while i smash the scene
i should leave earth, nothin left to do here
everyday is christmas and every night is new years
say whatever, i never been concerned about who hears
call my town sparta and i'm comin with two spears
i'm tellin you dawg, always got the spring collection in fall
i run my bill up makin executive calls
and with me, women be bulidin these skeptical walls
but once you've slept with one dime, man you've slept with 'em all
family, money, and music is all i ever knew
my necklace suffer from depression, it's forever blue
cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
i started the game at level two
i'm sayin, stop actin like teen girls are my only market
i parallel to fly and spurk, tony barket
and it's cool if you spill something, it's only carpet
that's why i get my interior color only dark shit
toronto's where you livin today, then you ain't makin records that people are driven to play
i would advise you to really make a move sooner than later
cause these are only the joints that i'm givin away, you feel me?


[talking:]

your vision's just been distorted
i'm so [?] i live this, you ask me what the business
and i write a sixteen and record it, uh
the waiting is over i think music need it
drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
people in the south want it chopped and screwed, i got this dude
they expectations imma exceed it uh
like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
when it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
finally here imma star with the timing
my swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
this for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
you only get the dough when you grindin
and so i grind like i'm listening to i wayne
my pain, you can experience through the rhyming boy!

the watch is yellowy-green thas sum awkward ice
i never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
i'm awful nice, lyrics that i often write
spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic
and i could pick you up from work when you get off the night
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man
i flow so cool like autumn nights
when i body this, tell me if the coffin's light
but don't try and tell me that a dolphins white
mislead drake that is not at all polite

they'll be trynna sub a nigga in like quizno's

[chorus: sos & drake]
all i need is sum weight, my scale, sum money for bail
a lil booth at the club for the whole cartel

i bet you it's the room cause i don't do no drugs
or maybe it's that 'tron cause i sure do have a buzz
baby either way i'm throwed and i am on a mission
so if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen
cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't christian
it's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen
girl holla at yo nigga i got that shit for low
ok maybe i don't but guarantee someone i know
wait let me slow it down (down) i'm gettin ahead (head)
plus it's gettin hot so i'm a take a seat instead (stead)
i'm lucky i ain't dead (dead) i'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll
we all of age and i ain't got nothin to hide ya'll
and in this game i'm a tidal when the tides small
so drop me in and i release just like a time bomb

every record that i've done the station here done played it
this the city that i run this the shit that i created
they tellin me i'm the one and i haven't even made it
maybe i'm hearin thangs cause i'm feelin like i'm faded

i'm feelin like i'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded
i'm feelin like i'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded

and naw it aint a buick

so how the f**k you want to do it
my nigga you better do it(aye)...do it
i say this here's a practice song
and lately i been out in hollywood

i clown other dudes on the low
i like to laugh alone
i get my cash alone
that's why i shop alone
this here's my uncle's car
i drive it and the top is gone
your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia
and coppertone
and girl i heard your man's a fed
don't bring that cop along
i'm running every single light
aint one i'm stopping on
this here's a classic jump
that big things are popping on
so baby wipe me down
i sell a watch and swap a home
i'm in this solo
no i do not have a chaperone
i'm in a proper zone
that's right the doctor's home
this here's my time
and i don't even think your clock is on

[chorus x1]


[drake:]
yeah, 9th wonder! don't judge me man
they tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
they say we lack substance
me, 'te and el' bout to prove 'em wrong though

[chorus: drake]
uh, we know what you're thinking love
you think we out smoking and drinking love
pushing big whips, chains clinking love
but y'all don't really know me like you think you know me
we know how you speculate
thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
claim we're early and be showing up extra late love
but y'all don't really know me like you think you know me

[drake:]
uh, el' be saying that i'm humble, i'm hella nice
for that i've been approached to sign to roc-a-fella twice
haters tell you all the rumors they heard
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like i'm ellen brice
my groove theory is that when you too cheery
they try to bring you down to the level they at
well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
that's why i am little nicky to these devils in rap
but, uh, they ain't thinking drake get smart girl
nah, they probably think i'll break your heart girl
haha, i can't lie, you probably right about it
and if you give me the ass quick, i'll probably write about it
but i hate it when they judge me on how i sound
i mean i spit that influential shit from my town
i don't know why you sitting on the couch
when you see i got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
you think taking your purse off
will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i could've been a local emcee
and you probably would've been worse off
so i'm a take this hat off, and i'm a hit it till i backs off
and then i'm back sorrowful
cause you thinking you can predict what happen
you the reason i'm thinking i'm getting sick of rapping

[chorus]

[phonte:]
you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and
swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
well, you can think what you want but
i think you've been watching too much bet: uncut
you need to get real and check out my real life
i ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like
but if you feel like putting all your notions aside
and talking to a real nigga, i'd gladly oblige
first name phonte, i'd be pleased to date ya
college educated, got degrees in papers
but i'm from the south where if you ain't snapping
or rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature
such an anomaly, speak so well
and talk so collegy, such an astonishing
contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
on behalf of them, i offer my apologies
maybe with me you'll unlearn
putting all niggas in a box of concerns
me, cause i ain't dumb, shit i'm well reared/red like sunburn
and after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon

[chorus]

[elzhi:]
they say you never judge a book by it's cover
though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
so i followed your words to take 'em in
and i don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
that's when i felt that i would need to
do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you
and try to get inside your head only
not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
so what i learned on my path to discover?
your story took one ugly turn after another
i saw we wasn't on the same page
i would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
so now i'm closing the case
you only out for the paperback that's written all over your face
no el' will never judge a book by it's cover
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[chorus]


[drake:]
me and you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby
i do things that you ain't used to baby
and take you back home to st. lucia baby
when raindrops hit the tin roof it's crazy,
that's a metaphor did i lose you baby?

when you are wet
and covered in sweat
i wipe your ass down like boosie baby

i love all my feed back
tell me to give it to you if you need that
touch right there whatever the speed's at
if it's over fast then i promise you a relapse

just charge that cell that i message you on
and if you let us girl i'm a bring the dresser along

half of that's ice and the rest patrón
show up on time for the class i'm teachin
'cause guaranteed i'm a bring a lesson along

an you just gotta bring yo breasts along
instead of holding out wondering what it could've been
i confess this address to you and
i'm the postman lookin for a slot i can put it in

but my room's soundproof

to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder (yeah)

someones gonna have to teach you a lesson

someones gonna have to straighten you right out
you've been a bad girl
someones gonna have to teach you
teach you teach you teach you

you can call me professor
but baby you broke the rules
you won't get the grade you want
unless you stay after school
you can work it off
baby i can give you extra credit
but there's something else
you were late to school
teach you teach you teach you
girl can i frisk you
search your body for
you look so guilty to me
if i make you nervous
it's 'cause you're hiding wmds
and i'm gonna sentence you
baby you can do your time on me
i can't let you go
i can't let you go

you were late to school
i'm gonna have to see you after class
you've been a bad girl
someones gonna have to teach you a lesson
you've been a bad girl
someone's gonna have to straighten you right out
you've been a bad girl


[chorus:]
i can't stop missing you, wish i was still with you
i can't stop missing you no, no, no, no
i can't stop missing you, wish i was still with you
i can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no

[drake:]
nah,
i never needed advice about
all the things you liked to do when it was lights out
i drove nice cars
i got a nice house
but now i'm steady missing you like a strikeout
i always wished i would of cared more
that's my only feeling inside when ever i get a song done
i'm scared that every girl i care for
will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
ya, and when she not by my side
and i hear that she gone
now it's like a shock to my pride
i don't care if she know
cause that's basically just a male ego
speaking aloud to some real people
but you can bounce back
go ladies,
more records, more sex, more babies
yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
tired missing you, i'm tryna make you a misses

[trey songz:]
i miss the way you kiss
i miss the way wear them heels and make it switch
miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
and i miss you staying here till the morning
miss the way you put on your makeup
miss the way you love me too much
it's everything about you baby
wanna know where you been lately
do you go out, do you still live at your old house
do you got somebody new in your life
cause i can't get you outta my mind

[hook:]
and i wanna erase but i can't stop seeing your face
in every girl i try to replace
you with why can't i get over it
simply cause i can't

[chorus:]
i can't stop missing you, (can't stop) wish i was still with you (with you)
i can't stop missing you no no no no
i can't stop missing you, (can't stop) wish i was still with you (with you)
i can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
i can't stop

[trey songz:]
missin everything you say,
missin all the crazy love we made
why'd you throw it all away
i want you to know it's been hell tryna do this with out you here
baby 07' supposed to be our year
you confront my worst fears
and i had my doubts every time you was going out
cause i knew you were tellin' me lies
and i can't get that outta my mind

[hook:]
and i wanna erase but i can't stop seeing your face
in every girl i try to replace
you with why can't i get over it
simply cause i can't

[chorus:]
i can't stop missing you, (can't stop) wish i was still with you (with you)
i can't stop missing you no, no, no, no
i can't stop missing you, (can't stop) wish i was still with you (with you)
i can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no

[bridge:]
wish i, could wake up and forget about you
not tryin to call you when i know i want to
(o wish i,) i gotta fight this feeling can't let it take over me
you just don't understand how much you were apart of me

[chorus:]
i can't stop missing you, (oooo no) wish i was still with you (with you)

i'm tryin to do it all tonight, i got plans
i got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
everything is going as right, as it can
they tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands

but you can miss me with all that
diss me then crawl back
i really wish ya'll would fall back
but gettin rich suppose to solve that
and these days women make offers and who the hell am i to say (no, no, no)
my ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
she in love
and as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
let them girls in for a drink
and i'm all in they ear
saying she should be the one i see, everytime, that i'm here
but when i'm not really even here
black surburban with the tint on it
fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
the game got these old hand prints on it
but i'm a be the one to pour cement on it
uh, and start over
and show up in the mars yellin tux i don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
so what i tend to do is think of today as the past
it's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)

throw your one's up in the air
throw your one's up in the air for her
throw your one's up in the air
throw your one's up


hey there, pretty girl
you know, exactly what you got
and i don't, blame you at all
you can't resist it
especially when the lights so bright
and the money so right
and it's comin in every single night
she don't wanna leave
she just stuck in

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

she doesn't ever worry
if she wants it, she'll get it on her own
she knows, there's more to life
and she's scared, of ending up alone
throw your ones up in the air
throw your ones up in the air for her
throw your ones up in the air
cause the ones you throw will get her out of

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

we all got dreams and we all star reachin'
all start peakin, all-star weekend
one hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
you be at the games lookin right, all season
but you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
ass low, ass low, i always request you
you go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
i give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
or why, or how, or when
tonight is probably 'bout to happen all over again
and she live in a mindset that i could never move to
until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
uh... because i never had you
although i would be glad to
i'd probably go and tattoo
your name on my heart
i swear, i start, to think, that i'm going crazy

throw your ones up in the air
throw your ones up in the air for her
throw your ones up in the air
cause the ones you throw will get her out of

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

too much would kill ya,
and when i leave,
i always come right back here,
the young spitter that everybody in rap fear,
a lot of you all still sounding like last year,
the game needs change and i'm the motherfucking cashier,
nickels for my thoughts,
dimes in my bed,
quarters of the kush,
shape the lines in my head,
take my verses too serious ya hate me,
cause i'm the one to paint a vivid picture no hd,
yeah,
i want it all,
that's why i strive for it,
diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
any awards show or party i'll get fly for it,
i know what's coming i just hope i'm alive for it.

[trey songz:]

[drake:]
yeah,
i want things to go my way,
but as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
and my mother tried to runaway from home,
but i left somethin in the car so i caught her in the driveway,
and she cried to me so i cried too,
and my stomach was soaking wet,
she only 5'2,
and 48 hours all before i showed up,
and brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
damn my reality just set in,
and even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
i do a lot of things,
hoping i never have to fit in,
so trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
my girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
and right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
and life change for us every single week,
so it's good,
but i know this ain't the peak though
cause i want...

[trey songz:]
i want the money,
money and the cars,
cars and the clothes,
the hoes,
i suppose,
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.

[drake:]
wise words from a decent man,
back when i was trying to put a ring on alicia hand,
this lost boy got fly without peter pan,
and my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
in person i am everything and more,
i'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
but inside i'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
i'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
just call me shop and bag drizzy,
and call me mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
and fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
while this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
i'm a kill it i promise this i know you mad,
i've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
to big homie use a flash if you must,
and i swear i ain't asking for much
all i want is

[trey songz:]
i want the money,
money and the cars,
cars and the clothes,
the hoes,
i suppose,
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.

it's like i know what i got to say,
i just don't know how to say it to you

[lil wayne:]
pardon the swag,
but bitches cartate,
long bread i don't eat shortcake,
how come i can't,
miss a woman like i can't miss court dates,
cheese,
but shes not in this portrait,
life's fine but i don not portray,
i'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
i don't want the glow,
i want the glow ray,
and i'm a fuck the world,
but this is just foreplay,
tired of hearing bullshit,
bring her on to cowshit,
haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
that's word to toronto,
so high up i got birds in the condo,
ain't that a female dog,
ask her who i am to her,
and she yell god,
weezy baby i go real hard
no further details boy.

[drake:]
spending every moment in the studio
i'd never said it'd be fair
but when you're all alone i hope you truly know
how bad i want to be there

[chorus:]

i took a night off for you

but keep your heels on
they're fittin' for what i'm about to do

just be quiet i'll do fine without ya help girl
can you work without a second for some fun
now you finally got a moment to yaself girl
and i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

[lloyd:]
i been waitin for so long to get you all alone
now i finally got you right here
so baby i'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone
cause i wanna make one thing clear
i want you on top
so let ya hair down
i took the night off for you
girl i'm gonna turn the lights off
but keep ya heels on
they're fittin' for what we're about to do

[chorus:]

and i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it
i know what to do with it

oh oh. it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio


why do i feel so alone
like everybody passing through the studio is in character
as if he acting out a movie role
talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
and i don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go

so they stick around, kicking out feedback
and i entertain it as if i need that
i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
my privacy about the only thing i need back

but it's hard to think of them polite flows
when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes
and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
and you still make it even when they say your flight close

eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
always said i'd say it all on the right track
but in this game you only lose when you fight back

black-diamond bracelets,
showing you the basics
i can't live and hold the camera
someone got to tape this
i make hits and like a bitch that's married, i ain't miss
24 hours from greatness,
i'm that close

don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
transitioning from fitting in to standing out
los angeles, cabanas, or atlanta south
watching hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out

and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out
so i park about 5 houses down
she say i shouldn't have it until i have the crown
but i don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

so she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus
but yet i roll around the fucking city like your highness
got niggaz reacting without a sinus
'cause what i'm working with is timeless

and promoters tryna get me out to they club
and say i have fun, but i can't imagine how
'cause i just see my ex-girl,
standing with my next girl,
standing with the girl that i'm fucking right now

and shit could get weird, unless they all down
and so i stay clear, we from a small town
and everybody talks, and everybody listen
and somehow the truth just always comes up missing

i've always been something that these labels can't buy
especially if they tryna take a piece of my soul
and sylvia be tellin' tez, "damn, drake fly."
and he just be like, "silly motherfucker, i know.
that was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
he just take them records and he gas up on 'em.
wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em.
surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em."

oh they did po, at least they tried to
and that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
and they think they can market you however they decide to

nah, but 40 told me to do me
and don't listen to anybody that knew me
'cause who have known me, would mean that there's a new me
and if you think i changed in the slightest could've fooled me

boy, and to my city i'm the 2-3
drug dealers live vicariously through me
i quit school and it's not because i'm lazy
i'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy

understand, i could get money with my eyes closed
lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo
so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll
sell that motherfucker to any rapper that i know

'cause they need it much more than i ever will
i got new shit, i'm getting better still
little niggaz put my name in they verses
'cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

future said, "'cause it's ye shit you better kill."
and i think this got that making-of-a-legend feel
problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
yeah, it's all i can say


[lykke li:]
hands down
i'm too proud for love
but with eyes shut
it's you i'm thinking of

[drake:]
but how we move from a to b it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
who i was before you
basically to see a change in me
i'd be losing, so i just ignore you, yeah
oh, oho
but your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
oh, oho
but maybe in time, in time, in time
i'll tell you

[chorus:]
a little bit, a little bit
a little bit in love with you
i guess that i'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
oh, oho

[drake:]
i know you told me break their hearts
but it's you i wanna take apart
and i will never ever be the first, to say it
but still i they know i ah ah ah

[lykke li:]
i would do it
push a button
pull a trigger
climb a mountain
jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby i love you love you
a little bit

you would do it
you would say it
you'd mean it
i would let you do it
it was you and i and i only
ha, hm

i think i'm a little bit
little bit
a little bit in love with you
but only if you're a little bit
little bit
little bit
in lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me

[drake:]
i hope they never find out
what they already know, know, know
as soon as it's official
we'll have to let it go, go, go
so we don't confirm the fling
keep avoiding all the questions
you could teach me many things
i'm just scared to learn a lesson

the pressures on
both hearts beat like a metronome
both n'sync like a justin song
feels so right but it's just so wrong
i wonder where my whereabouts?
where niggas that i know, tryna talk my girl out
and her friends say i ain't the one to go for
she just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
oh, well, tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
with a girl that i know, yeah, tell her all that, that
and as for you i think i know you're the one
the closest i've come
i'm probably...

a little bit
a little bit
a little bit in love with you
i guess that i'm a little bit
a little bit
a little bit
a little bit in love with you
oh oho
lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
oh, oho, oh, oho


you know a lot of girls be thinking my songs are about them, but this is not to get confused, this one's for you

baby you're my everything, you're all i ever wanted
we could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
you be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
i want this forever, i swear i could spend whatever on it

'cause she hold me down every time i hit her up

put the key under the mat
and you know i be over there

i be over there, shawty i be over there
i be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there

and you don't even have to ask twice
you could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
that's when you're the prettiest, i hope that you don't take it wrong
you don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
you know that i'm working i'll be there soon as i make it home

and she a patient in my waiting room
never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
and until 'em girls prove it
i'm the one that never get confused with

'cause baby you're my everything, you're all i ever wanted
we could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
you be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
i want this forever, i swear i could spend whatever on it

'cause she hold me down every time i hit her up
when i get right i promise that we gon' live it up
she made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
and i say the same thing every single time

i say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
you the best i ever had best i ever had best i ever had best i ever had
i say you the fuckin'

sex, love, pain, baby i be on that tank shit
buzz so big, i could probably sell a blank disk
when my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
and niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister

magazine paper girl the money ain't the issue
they bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
she call me the referee 'cause i be so official
my shirt ain't got no stripes but i can make your pussy whistle

like the andy griffith theme song
and who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love, you're the one i lean on
feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
all up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jack pot

baby you're my everything, you're all i ever wanted
we could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
you be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
i want this forever, i swear i could spend whatever on it

'cause she hold me down every time i hit her up
when i get right i promise that we gon' live it up
she make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
and i say the same thing every single time
i say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
you the best i ever had best i ever had best i ever had best i ever had
i say you the fuckin'

see this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
just make sure they that special somebody
young money
you know who you are, i got ya


[verse 1: drake]
my name is drizzy
and i ain't perfect
and i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
ain't on the fence about it
i ain't mister fenny
i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls
caught  up in superficial glammer
who dress like sara jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addiction
and i'm the one that will feed it
but truly you bad enough
where you don't really even need it
you could show up to the party
on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
of you and your possie partying
drinking what you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all looking like you just landed
i don't really understand it
i'm not sure i'm comprehending
but these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spending screaming

[chorus (2x)]
i got to be unstoppable [2x]
ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x]

[verse 2: lil wayne]
my name is whezzy
i'm almost perfect
and i work harder than hard working
bizarre circus
that's what my bars surface
therefore i act a clown
even when i laying on my back i'm never backing down
so over stand me
i got a condo in miami
and my door mat is always sandy
and i run louisiana
but i never pulled a hami
and i got a condo in atlanta
and i always wear a bandanna
and when it come down to stunning
you boys are just bunting
and i swagging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl singing to my shit like
a lo lo lollipop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
and she say i pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
hold this
text me whenever you want some more dick
more dick
old bitch
young bitch
but i be like damn
all i got is one dick

[chorus (2x)]
i got to be unstoppable [2x]
ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x]


[lil wayne:]

try to cross me over
i just fake left then i break right
stupid animal tricks

i forgot to call you on your birthday
you swear you're the last thing on my mind
there is nothing i could do to fix it
all you ever asked me for was time

when the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
and i finally get a moment to myself
i will realize you were everything i'm missing
and you tell me you're in love with someone else

so can you do me a favor?
if i pull it together, make it sooner than later
we won't be here forever
and i realized i waited too long
but please don't move on

you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 

you just changed your hair and it looks perfect
wish i was the first to let you know
every chance i get to make it better
i just find a way to let it go

when the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
and i finally get a moment to myself
i will realize you were everything i'm missing
and you tell me you're in love with someone else

so can you do me a favor?
if i pull it together, make it sooner than later
we won't be here forever
and i realized i waited too long
but please don't move on

you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 

the girl or the world?
you see: someone gotta lose
i thought i could have it all
do i really got to choose?

what good is all the cash, if it doesn't buy time?
and what good is being famous, if i'm never on your mind?

night's fallen, light's glowing
and i'm just trying to pay the price owing
and i don't wanna feel the comfort for my ice showing
and i ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
nigga nice going

is it worth it? that decision?
'cause hearts break and i ain't tryna be in that collision
so i'mma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'cause i better look good, girl
if this my chance i swear

so can you do me a favor?
if i pull it together make it sooner than later
we won't be here forever
and i realized i waited too long
but please don't move on

you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else 
you don't need no one else


[omarion:]
even though your all alone
all i know when i am gone

i just wanna keep you warm
i'm comin' back, i'm comin' back

yes, i'll be there
yes, i'll be there

cause when i'm all alone i think about your face
and how i wanna touch, i'm so far away (i'm so)

all i wanna do is give you all of me now
are you ready? are you ready? yeah

[chorus:]
don't go missing
fly with me
don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me
don't go missing
fly with me
check it out, check it out
don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me

[drake:]
i'm aware that we just met
i don't wanna leave you yet

promise that i won't forget
i'm comin' back, i'm comin' back

yes, i'll be there
yes, i'll be there

about to board a flight
sittin' at the gate

i just wanna touch you
but i'm so far away (i'm so)

all i wanna do is give you all of me now
are you ready? are you ready? oh

[chorus]


[verse 1:]
uh, i'm just so far gone, october's own, please leave me alone
drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
see my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
where did we go wrong, where do we belong
caught up in the game and it's one i can't postpone
meaning if it rains i'm the one it's raining on
when my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me don't forget 'em and i promise that i won't
feelin' so distant from everyone i've known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
i've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
it's only been 3 years look at how i've grown
i'm just in my zone, i call this shit the calm
yea, but i'm the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom, and i swear my word is bond
everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
i'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
i know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

[talking:]
you know, everything gone be alright, i promise. a
pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
you know, so... forgive me.

[verse 2:]
uh, and life is so insane, look what i've became, tryna make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
it's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention therefore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
tryna enjoy myself with taz in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
it's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
so i'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
hopin' western union doing currency exchange
cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
like, how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn, and i could only feel his pain
cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
so i'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
he say he love me i just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
i'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
call me heartbreak drake i'm the hardest one to tame
as a man i'm just honest as a artist i'm a king
with my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
yea, and see this is the thang
what they viewing as braggin' is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain...

[talking:]
me, yea... uh, i said i call this shit the calm.
but i'm the furthest thing from calm.
i swear i'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... man.


this here is on some truthful shit!
it's seems like everything i do you're used to it!
and i hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with!
that's when i gotta hide
what i'm feeling inside

so you still think i am confident and dumb?
is this gonna last?
you're up on a pedestal
are we moving too fast?
feels like i'm in crazy competition with the past
that's why i gotta ask

is anything i'm doin' brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything i'm doin' brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
girl
(aye aye aye)

this here is something personal
i highly doubt this feeling is reversible
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide
and put mistakes aside

so i don't ever question you and damn
i can't even find the perfect brush
so i can paint what's going through my mind
racing 'gainst myself but i'm a couple steps behind
that's why i gotta ask

is anything i'm doin' brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything i'm doin' brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
oh, girl
(aye aye aye)

is anything i'm doing brand new?
new, new, new, new, new
oh, is everything i'm doing too late?
late, late, late

did he take your clothes off just like this?
did he give you loving just like this?
did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
tell me, baby, am i too late?

is anything i'm doing brand new?
brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

show me if this is brand new
brand new, brand new

and it's comin in every single night
she don't wanna leave
she just stuck in

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

she doesn't ever worry
if she wants it, she'll get it on her own
she knows, there's more to life
and she's scared, of ending up alone
throw your ones up in the air
throw your ones up in the air for her
throw your ones up in the air
cause the ones you throw will get her out of

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

we all got dreams and we all star reachin'
all start peakin, all-star weekend
one hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
you be at the games lookin right, all season
but you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
ass low, ass low, i always request you
you go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
i give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
or why, or how, or when
tonight is probably 'bout to happen all over again
and she live in a mindset that i could never move to
until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
uh... because i never had you
although i would be glad to
i'd probably go and tattoo
your name on my heart
i swear, i start, to think, that i'm going crazy

throw your ones up in the air
throw your ones up in the air for her
throw your ones up in the air
cause the ones you throw will get her out of

houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlanta, she just stuck in
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas (ay)
houstatlantavegas (ay) houstatlantavegas
and she dance, to this song
and she dance, to this song
and it goes, "hey now now, watch her go down"
oohh-ohhh-ohh

just enough to solve your problems,
too much would kill ya,
and when i leave,
i always come right back here,
the young spitter that everybody in rap fear,
a lot of you all still sounding like last year,
the game needs change and i'm the motherfucking cashier,
nickels for my thoughts,
dimes in my bed,
quarters of the kush,
shape the lines in my head,
take my verses too serious ya hate me,
cause i'm the one to paint a vivid picture no hd,
yeah,
i want it all,
that's why i strive for it,
diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
any awards show or party i'll get fly for it,
i know what's coming i just hope i'm alive for it.

[drake:]
yeah,
i want things to go my way,
but as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
and my mother tried to runaway from home,
but i left somethin in the car so i caught her in the driveway,
and she cried to me so i cried too,
and my stomach was soaking wet,
she only 5'2,
and 48 hours all before i showed up,
and brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
damn my reality just set in,
and even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
i do a lot of things,
hoping i never have to fit in,
so trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
my girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
and right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
and life change for us every single week,
so it's good,
but i know this ain't the peak though
cause i want...

[trey songz:]
i want the money,

cars and the clothes,

i suppose,
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.

[drake:]
wise words from a decent man,
back when i was trying to put a ring on alicia hand,
this lost boy got fly without peter pan,
and my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
in person i am everything and more,
i'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
but inside i'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
i'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
just call me shop and bag drizzy,
and call me mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
and fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
while this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
i'm a kill it i promise this i know you mad,
i've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
to big homie use a flash if you must,
and i swear i ain't asking for much
all i want is

[trey songz:]

money and the cars,
cars and the clothes,
the hoes,
i suppose,
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.

i just wanna be,
successful.
i just wanna be,
i just wanna be,
successful.

it's like i know what i got to say,
i just don't know how to say it to you

[lil wayne:]
pardon the swag,
but bitches cartate,
long bread i don't eat shortcake,
how come i can't,
miss a woman like i can't miss court dates,
cheese,
but shes not in this portrait,
life's fine but i don not portray,
i'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
i don't want the glow,
i want the glow ray,
and i'm a fuck the world,
but this is just foreplay,
tired of hearing bullshit,
bring her on to cowshit,
haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
that's word to toronto,
so high up i got birds in the condo,
ain't that a female dog,
ask her who i am to her,
and she yell god,
weezy baby i go real hard
no further details boy.


you know a lot of girls be thinking my songs are about them, but this is not to get confused, this one's for you

i be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there

and you don't even have to ask twice
you could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
that's when you're the prettiest, i hope that you don't take it wrong
you don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
you know that i'm working i'll be there soon as i make it home

when my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
and niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister

magazine paper girl the money ain't the issue
they bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
she call me the referee 'cause i be so official
my shirt ain't got no stripes but i can make your pussy whistle

like the andy griffith theme song
and who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love, you're the one i lean on
feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
all up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jack pot

baby you're my everything, you're all i ever wanted
we could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
you be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
i want this forever, i swear i could spend whatever on it

'cause she hold me down every time i hit her up
when i get right i promise that we gon' live it up
she make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
and i say the same thing every single time

[verse 1:]
uh, i'm just so far gone, october's own, please leave me alone
drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
see my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
where did we go wrong, where do we belong
caught up in the game and it's one i can't postpone
meaning if it rains i'm the one it's raining on
when my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me don't forget 'em and i promise that i won't
feelin' so distant from everyone i've known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
i've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
it's only been 3 years look at how i've grown
i'm just in my zone, i call this shit the calm
yea, but i'm the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom, and i swear my word is bond
everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
i'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
i know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

[talking:]
you know, everything gone be alright, i promise. a
pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
you know, so... forgive me.

[verse 2:]
uh, and life is so insane, look what i've became, tryna make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
it's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention therefore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
tryna enjoy myself with taz in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
it's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
so i'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
hopin' western union doing currency exchange
cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
like, how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn, and i could only feel his pain
cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
so i'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
he say he love me i just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
i'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
call me heartbreak drake i'm the hardest one to tame
as a man i'm just honest as a artist i'm a king
with my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
yea, and see this is the thang
what they viewing as braggin' is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the single handed reason i remain...

[talking:]
me, yea... uh, i said i call this shit the calm.
but i'm the furthest thing from calm.
i swear i'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... man.


[drake talking:]
this is why i do this shit.
i think they call this, uhm, venting.

[verse 1:]
look
uhh.

this is me.
still the same.
they want the hits.
i play the game.
no auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
what up lil braw.
what up slum ville.
i hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
the fans thinking that we all signed for one mill.
equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
that ain't how it works.
that ain't that how it goes.
and i be getting high to balance out the lows.
and i could use a writer to balance out my flows.
but i never share my thoughts,
this is all a nigga knows.
and every time i try, it opens up my eyes.
these verses are a chance to remembered and reprised.
and i would be performing just as long as i'm alive.
so every word i utter will be mine.

[chorus:]
don't believe the lies.
look me in my eyes.
please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
i remember you.
this feeling isn't new.
so please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

[verse 2:]
i never cried when pac died.
but i probably will when hov does.
and if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
and i'll be standing in a puddle.
i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
and ima keep it honest.
i'm so tired of being subtle.
its just me, forty, o, and neek standing in a huddle.
staring at the members of my team.
who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme.
just know that i'm in debt for you defending all our dreams.
i hope you tell your family this shit ain't what it seems.
but yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless.
and know i pop bottles cause i bottle my emotions.
at least i put it all in the open.

[chorus:]
don't believe the lies.
look me in my eyes.
please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
i remember you.
this feeling isn't new.
so please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

[verse 3:]
look.
fuck all yall.
we ignore feelings here.
premature millionaires.
welcome to my realest year.
yeah.
i swear we making a killing here.
i should be on top of the world here just chilling here.
uh.
but its funny having fans.
who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
and realize when your there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same.
yeah.
and plus things are just surreal at home
people think i've changed just because my appeal has grown
and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
i think i'm scared of what the future holds.
i was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
every girl i meet thinks i'm fucking groupie hoes.
the honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
all my old friends think i got a new crowd.
and people seem to notice every time i do smile.
i guess that mean they come few and far between.
even though am living out what you would call the dream.
yeah.
and my uncle ain't even messaging me.
and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
i hope this isn't one of those forever things.
its funny how money can change everything.

[chorus:]
don't believe the lies.
look me in my eyes.
please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
i remember you.
this feeling isn't new.
so please don't be scared of me.
please don't be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.


[drake - verse 1:]
money just changed everything, i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago
truth over fame, you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear them talking, i just don't know what to make of it
hate is so familiar to me, i'm slowly embracing it
doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
yeah, and my dreams are who i'm racing with
and you can see i'm pacing it so that i'm always chasing it
wayne put me right here, that's who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
yeah, this life is something i would die for
octobers own, but its looking like july 4
i just wish they'd let you try it first
this time i'm really going off, fireworks

[drake bridge:]
today it begins
i missed them before but won't miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means

[alicia keys - chorus:]
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night it's fireworks
every night it's fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks

[drake - verse 2:]
i'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how i'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasn't love i just thought you fuck with me
who could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
damn, i kept my wits about me luckily
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
but i was curious and i'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good, all and all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah, i should've looked up in the sky at first
now i can see it in her eyes
fireworks

[alicia keys chorus]

[drake - verse 3:]
everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
it's been years, though, i just learn to deal with it
for real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city i let her explore
and now she's sayin' she's more lonely than ever before
how many of our parents' marriages lasted?
i was only 5, i bet i barely reacted
i'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
i want to witness love, i've never seen it close
yeah, but i guess i gotta find it first, that's why i'm really going off
fireworks

[drake bridge]

[alicia keys - chorus]


[drake singing:]
things have been so crazy and hectic
i should have gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
it's probably better anyhow
so if you gotta go
if there's anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if you looking for a purpose
you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was joking
now i'm all singing karaoke
further than i've ever been
so if you gotta go
if there's any way i can help

[drake rapping:]
isn't it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
damn, of all the places you could go
i just thought you'd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
i'm always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
don't be fooled by the money i'm still just young and unlucky
i'm surprised you couldn't tell

[drake singing:]
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you looking for a purpose

i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous


yesterday when we were getting high, you were invited.
you would've liked it. i-i know you all too well.
i said that we could kiss the past goodbye, but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it.
you can stay but shawty here i go...

[verse 1]
uh, should i spend the weekend in vegas? 
i'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it. 
i mean, how could i forget? my memories never faded.
i can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it. 
i am, still here with who i started with.
the game needed life, i put my heart in it.
i blew myself up, i'm on some martyr shit. 
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship.
uh. i'm 23, with a money tree.
growing more too, i just planted a hundred seeds.
it's ironic, 'cause my mother was a flourist,
and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous.
it's happening penny lane, just like you said.
i avoided the coke game, and went with sprite instead.
uh huh, that's word to the millions that they putting up.
i'm trying to do better than good enough.

[chorus]
what am i afraid of? this is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
but people i don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
you promised me you would never change.
you promised me you would never change. 

[verse 2]
uh. am i wrong for making light of my situation? clap on.
when 40 got some shit for me to snap on.
now that i'm on, i don't really want to worry about getting back on.
i'm just trying to stay on, get my fucking buffet on.
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home.
and i be acting like i don't know how to work a phone.
but hit redial you see that i just called, some chick i met at the mall,
that i barley know at all and..
plus this woman that i messed with unprotected
texting saying that she wish she would've kept it.
the one that i'm laying next to just looked over and read it.
man i couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, i'm holding on by a thread it's..
like i'm high right now, the guy right now, and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now.
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now,
'cause we just having the time of our lives right now.

[chorus]
what am i afraid of? this is suppose to be what dreams are made of.
but people i don't have the time to hang with, always look at me and say the same shit..(they say)
you promised me you would never change.
you promised you would never change. 

[verse 3]
well all right. uh. i live by some advices, girl lisa told me.
the other day, lisa told that she missed the old me.
which made me question when i went missing.
and when i start treating my friends different.
maybe it was the fast paced switch up.
or the two guns in my face during the stick up.
maybe cause the girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up.
or the fact i haven't seen em since they locked big rich up.
i know. at the same time i'm quick to forget.
i'm bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets. 
burn it all, burn it all, i'm starting it fresh.
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed.
did i just trade free time for camera time?
will i blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
i just need some closure. 
aint no turning back for me i'm in till it's over.


[drake:]
i know way too many people here right now that i didn't know last year
who the fuck are y'all?
i swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
but i just can't remember it all
what am i doing, what am i doing?
oh, yeah, that's right.
i'm doing me, i'm doing me
i'm living life right now, man
and this what i'mma do 'til it's over
'til it's over. it's far from over

alright, bottles on me
'long as someone drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y'all thinking?
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
'bout to set it off in this bitch jada pinkett
i shouldn't have drove, tell me how i'm getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
i can teach you how to speak my language rosetta stone
i swear this life is like the sweetest thing i've ever known
about to go thriller mike jackson on these niggas
all i need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers
super good smidoke a package of the swishers
i did it overnight. it couldn't happen any quicker
y'all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out i'll make them a believer
it wouldn't be the first time i've done it throwing hundreds

oh, yeah, that's right.
i'm doing me, i'm doing me
i'm living life right now, man
and this what i'mma do 'til it's over
'til it's over. it's far from over

uh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me.
i know better than that it's just game
it's just what comes with the fame
and i'm ready for that. i'm just saying
i really can't complain. everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
i really can't see the end getting any closer
but i'll probably still be the man when everything is over
so i'm riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me? can you see me? get your visine on
y'all just do not fit the picture
turn your widescreen on
if you thinking i'mma quit before i die dream on
man, they treat me like a legend
am i really this cold?
i'm really too young to be feeling this old
it's about time you admit it. who you kidding, man?
nobody's ever done it like i did it
ah

[drake:]
i know way too many people here right now that i didn't know last year
who the fuck are y'all?
i swear it feels like the last few nights we've been everywhere and back
but i just can't remember it all

in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
in the mall steady racking up the air miles
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
and you don't do it for the man, men never notice
you just do it for yourself you're the fucking coldest
intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
i've always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a little class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look i really think that nobody does it better
i love the way you put it together

independent with the demeanor of an r&b singer
naked ring finger (check)

that if you were a star you’d be the one i’m searching for
all the girls they got attention
but i just always feel like they're in need of something you got
its obvious you’re pretty
heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
and if there’s nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those fucking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what you're doing
put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebody’s taking pictures

[chorus:]
shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh

[the dream:]
girl you’re the greatest
and if he say you aint

you’re the finest
and if he say you aint

hey baby, everytime you come around

hey lady, step into my heart
and put you in the louboutins

you shut that muthafucker down down down

[drake:]
shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
i could bring her through and shut them down, onyx
no, you’re not imagining, they’re looking at you long stares
even though she’s standing out she looks like she belongs here
you feel the hours pass, until you find somethin’
i feel like when she moves – the time doesn’t
yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin
and your cousin fine, but she don’t have my heart beating in double time
you just shut it down, girl
who told the cops where the party was?
why do i feel like i found the one?
what’s in these shots that you ordered us?
damn, i mean you sure know how to paint a town
ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down

[drake & the dream:]
you shut that shit down (down down down)
you shut it down (down down down)

[drake:]
yo, this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
i haven’t slept in days, and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways, so i’m single
thinking about what we had and missing you,
but i ain’t santa, i got something for these bad bitches too
i mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
they always seem to catch me with the women that i brought out
baby, don’t hold on too long ’cause thats how them stories start out,
and all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out, it’s drizzy
always gone but never hard to find
and since you can’t escape me, do i ever cross your mind?
because all this shit is new to me, i’m learning to behave,
and still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but i’m good
i know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle,
i’m looking forward to the memories of right now
never forgettin’ from where i came,
and no matter where i’m headed, i promise to stay the same

[chorus - jeezy & drake:]
i’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
ask your girl, i’m the realest nigga she been around
when i pull up in something new and park it by the haters,
and when you get to talkin’ bout the greatest
i just really hope that (you’d think of me) [3x]
i'm doin my thing [3x]
(‘cause i’m trynna be unforgettable)

[young jeezy:]
this just might be my realest flow ever,
when i say for life, y’all say forever
it’s hard, but its fair, i told that girl "life hurts"
the closest you gonna get to this is a pac t-shirt
the name’s young, baby, you know i live that thug life
the good die young, so i’mma need a thug wife
yeah, i’m talking his and her firearms
know our jewelry prolly louder than a car alarm
yeah, i’m in my "used to have to sneak the car"
now my insides are lookin like a snickers bar
yeah, i’m talking caramel leathers,

she saying shit in them streets, so whats the deal?
and i’ve done everything in the a, but fuck chilli
so welcome to my life, no two days the same
like for y’all to meet the love of my life, her name’s the game

[chorus - jeezy & drake]

[jeezy talking:]

yeah, drizzy we got em lil brah,
unforgettable, you’ll never forget this, ya understand me?
timeless homie, unforgettable

let me know, let me know


[verse 1: drake]
i've been up for 4 days
getting money both ways
dirty and clean, i could use a glass of cold spades
rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
i keep thinking how young you can die from old age
they always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
and even though i laugh it off, man, it's probably true
cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
i'm just here making all the music that they party to
but party on, party on, all night nigga
i got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
i've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
uhh, but i just wanna tell the truth
before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
this shit feel like when fredro starr was at sunset park
stuntin' hard in his yellow goose
yeah, but i'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
but a target nonetheless and i just started
was that directed at moi? it can't be
they must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
yeah, and i'm just filling up this daily planner
gettin' busy 'cause i'm a star, no spangled banner
jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
and i just say i wrote it for your girlfriends, kelsey grammar
yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
welcome to hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
and if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
don't get impatient when it takes too long
drink it all even when it tastes too strong
yeah, i gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
i promise to always give you me, the real me

[chorus: drake]
who would have thought
i'd be caught in this life?
let's celebrate with a toast
and get lost in tonight
and make it all light up
(hey, guru, tell hom' to go to open that ace right there),
wait until the sun goes down
we gon' make this bitch light up
even when the sun goes down
i'm gon' make this go

[verse 2: jay-z]
owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
i'm the man of the hour
triple entendre, don't even ask me how
con edison flow, i'm connected to a higher power
bright life'd make your whole city light up
a trillion-watt light bulb, when i'm in the nightclub
i just landed in that g450
caught the mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(uh) y'all can miss me with that money talk
the smart money's on hov, fuck what the dummies talk
i don't do too much blogging
i just run the town, i don't do too much jogging
(unh) i ain't got a scar yet
'cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
drake, here is how they gon' come at you
will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
in disguise, in the form of a favor
the barzini me, watch for the traitors
(unh) i done seen it all, done it all
that's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off
the summer's ours, the winter too
top down in the winter, that's what winners do
and to these niggas i'm like windows 7
you let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
and since no good deed go unpunished
i'm not as cool with niggas as i once was
i once was, cool as the fonz was
but these bright lights turned me to a monster
sorry, mama, i promised it wouldn't change me
but i would've went insane had i remained the same me

[chorus: drake]

neeks got the weed, hush got a gun
cj got my credit cards and a lot of ones
yeah, i'm in the city of the purple sprite
someone tell maliah i'm on fire, she should work tonight
call up king of diamonds and tell chyna it'd be worth the flight
i'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
she just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
i don't judge her, i don't judge her but i could never love her
'cause to her i'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
that's why me and lil jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
i'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
and drake just stand for do right and kill everything
i love nicki minaj, i told her i'd admit it
i hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
and girl, i'm fuckin' serious, i'm wit' it if you wit' it
'cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
ugh, damn! i think you caught me in a moment

and life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
so come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'cause it's on

yeah, girl it's on
you know what it is when i finally make it home
i just hope that you miss me a little when i'm gone
yeah i just hope that you miss me a little when i'm gone
and you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
i know things have changed, know i used to be around more
but you should miss a little when i'm gone
i just hope that you miss me a little when i'm gone, gone, gone

[lil wayne:]
ooh, shit, motherfucker, god damn

i walk light so i don't piss the ground off
man, i swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
ew, that's nasty
yes, i am weezy but i ain't asthmatic
james bond cologne, honey i put on
make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
voice baritone, haters carry on
beat the pussy up, call me larry holmes
young money's jerry sloan, i turn every stone
when she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
to the women i condone, better write me when i'm gone
no, i'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but i do pack bone
uh, i'm a love machine
and i won't work for nobody but you
it's only me and her 'cause the bugatti a coupe
it's blood gang, slime, but i parlay with snoop
i ain't lyin', i shoot, you don't need signs for proof
turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
and when i'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
man, i got so many styles, i am a group
ha ha, damn! i'll be gone 'til november
but fuck it, i ain't trippin', i know drizzy gon' kill 'em
i'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
momma said "if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
gotta do it one time for haiti – what up, zo?
weezy f. baby and the f is for front do'
'cause that's where i brang it

[drake:]

i just hope that you miss me, miss me
miss me, miss me
miss me a little when i’m gone
miss me a little when i’m gone, gone, gone
oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa


[verse 1]
all night i - been staring--can you tell i want you?
can't be too - wide open--there's nothing i won't do
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
just thought you should 
know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-whoa-ooh

[chorus]
that's when you start to laugh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
saying i just want what i can't have (oh-oh, oh-oh)
won't even give me a chance (oh-oh, oh-oh)
claiming i'm just not as serious as you
shawty if you only knew
this is serious...unh

[verse 2]
i wish i - wasn't famous
i wish i - was still in school
so that i could have you in my dorm room
i would put it on you--crazy

[chorus]

[guitar interlude]

[repeat 7x] ho-whoa-oh yeah


i'm more than just an option
(hey, hey, hey)
refuse to be forgotten
(hey, hey, hey)
i took a chance with my heart
(hey, hey, hey)
and i feel it taking over

i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

i'm more than just a number
(hey, hey, hey)
i doubt you'll find another
(hey, hey, hey)
so every single summer
(hey, hey, hey)
i'll be the one that you'll remember and

i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

it's more than just a mission
(hey, hey, hey)
you hear, but you don't listen
(hey, hey, hey)
you better pay attention
(hey, hey, hey)
and get what you've been missing

i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

too many times i've been wrong
i guess being right takes too long
i'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
but give all i have to you and

i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i better find your loving, i better find your heart
i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
i bet if i give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart


[drake:]
you could thank me now
uh, go ‘head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn’t always come so instead
it’s okay,
you could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here i go

[verse 1:]
mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately i’ve been drinking like there’s a message in a bottle
aloha’s to women with no ties
to men that i know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
i’m on the brink of influential
i’m here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesn’t add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch,
what a year for you niggas
it’s december 31st and we in miami just meditating
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like i stayed up
and we just wanna party, patron straight up
fuck that old shit, i’m on new things
ovo clique, red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
who’d thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
i could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike but gotta ai him for your survival
damn, i swear sports and music are so synonomous
’cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now...
and oh my goodness you’re welcome
you’re welcome
at this point me is who i’m trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know it’s going down
in case another chance never comes around...

[chorus]

[verse 2:]
uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think i’m spending all my time with the wrong women
i think i have a chance at love but knowing me i miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn’t realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit her friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump latte’s
and low fat muffin’s, do i?
or is missing what we had outta the question
i’m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroe’s who’s there before it all
i guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro’s
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
i know there somewhere watching so i’m trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
you’ll find it next to me
and tell me i’m the highest, guess we finally get to see
i’m feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it’s probably why i’m in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
i’m sorry, poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
i’m the black sheep, but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
i’m in the world where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and i’m aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while i’m still here in this position...

[chorus]


i forgot about you last night
for the first time in a long time i did, ohhh
i was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
an amazing conversation
with this girl named lorraine, who says she's from l.a.
and keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
ohhhhhh, she could be good for me
ohhh, that's when you text me
tell me that you miss me, i forget about lorraine
and the fact she's right here with me
she's starin in my face, somethin had to change
thought that all these feelings went away
ohhh...

i hate getting, messages from you, from you
it's like you know the perfect shit to say
fucks up my whole day
i thought that all these feelings went away
i hate getting, messages from you, from you
especially when you say you should've stayed
fucks up my whole day
i thought that all these feelings went away
ohhh

ooh, i hate the shit you do
i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do
i hate the shit you do, i hate the shit you do
but i still text you back, say i miss you too


[drake]

follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?
thought it over and decided tonight is the night.

[background voice]
yeah i hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.

i-i-i'm ready for ya.
i-i-i'm ready for ya.
so keep thinkin' you the man,
'cause it's all part of my plan.

i wonder if you'll be able to handle me.
mental picture, no cameras please.

[background voice]
yeah i hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.

[drake - verse]
uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,
flash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,
i know you get impatient as the time pass
you say you want it fast... define fast
'cause i can speed it up, and make it last
and i could audition for this, and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future, i could co-direct your past,
and make damn sure you never forget it
committed
i'm ready, i'm with it... still here like a statue
pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,
you say you got baggage, well i'm packed too
plus i got a sex pistol, pointed right at you "bang!"
the baddest women ever and the hardest out,
proven over and over again that's why i'm hard to doubt
plus i'm young money 'till the death, i took the carter route
i'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about

[background voice]
yeah i hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.
got my mind made up. i-i-i'm ready for ya.
i'm in control, but with you bein' the man,
you don't seem to understand that i-i-i'm ready for ya.
i-i-i'm ready for ya.
i-i-i'm ready for ya.
so keep thinkin' you the man,
'cause it's all part of my plan.
i-i-i'm ready for ya.

r.i.p to the girl

[chorus]

the smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
i know they ain't getting money like we do so it’s on.
i was looking for the one now i’m feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
i was wrong now i’m back up in this bitch going harder than i did watch me do it

[hook]
and i’mma do it all
feeling like the old me
you don’t even know me
i’mma do it all
i’mma do it all
probably why i’m back up in this bitch going harder than i did
watch me do it

[drake - verse 1]
tonight i’m into breaking up
somebody’s home
i’m drunk as ever
i’m not alone, i’m with my people
i know you love it
i don’t just do it
i over does it
i be getting money so long
its just paper to me
take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
you can never reminisce when you forget it all
careful what you wish for, you might just get it all
now my life is angel hair and pignot grigio
baby forget about it
i'm headed wherever this muthfucking jet is routed
you can’t have my heart the doctor told me i’d be dead without it
my judgements never clouded
that’s why i’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
i’m about whatever man
i’m tryna fuck with tinkerbell in never neverland
but i’m polite about it
baby after you
i’ve had a glass or too so somebody remind me where i am

[chorus]

[hook]

[drake - verse 2]
tryna get the green like i’m waiting at a long light
broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
where’d i just put my bow tie
millionnaire multi
rest in peace to big and praises to the most high
getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
i’m the man now, i guess that parts a given
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
i ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
i love from it though, i’ve been down and i got up
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
because everythings easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
i’m still the mafia, still run the commitee
ny forever nigga, diddy,

[chorus]

[hook]


would of came back for you
i just needed time
to do what i have to do
caught in a life
i can't let it go, whether that's right
i will never know
hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
tried to be patient and waited to long
but i woulda came back, but i woulda came back...

i talk slicker than a pimp from augusta
who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what's up witcha?
i hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
i took some sense and made a nickel of it
i'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
with those lips that all that lipstick covers
you're never too grown up to miss and hug her
and girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
i'm on some marvin gay shit, a bunch of distant lovers
this ain't the life that i'm used to
reintroduced to people i've been introduced to
did you forget me?
or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
and fear that i won't remember, i wish you could still accept me for me
i miss memphis, tennessee, my cousins, my dad
the simplistic beauty that all of them southerners have
i'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
feelin' like all four members of color me bad
in one nigga, amazing shit
i got that courtney love for ya, that crazy shit
i don't drink every bottle i own, i be agin' shit
and i got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains
the seats for these heat games
i really think you stare at yourself and you see things
la familia, i've been inducted and instructed
to stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck wit
fuck is up?
havin' lunch and debatin' ferrari prices
23 and goin' through a midlife crisis
but trust me, i still deliver like a midwife
and no, i'm not sayin' i'm the nicest, i just live life like it
uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
to be far from hood, but to understand the streets
i never threw away that paper with my grammy speech
because i haven't hit the pinnacles i plan to reach
yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
and, baby, i'll never forget none of that
girl, i told you i was coming back

would of came back for you
i just needed time
to do what i have to do
caught in a life
i can't let it go, whether that's right
i will never know
hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
tried to be patient and i waited to long
but i woulda came back, woulda came back...


[intro: drake]
yesterday when we were gettin high
you were invited, you would've liked it
uh-uh-i-i know you all too well
i said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it
you could stay but shorty here i go

[termanology]
termanology... uh
they call me one thing, but they treat me like another
i'm cheatin but do i love her, well more than any other
so it's personal, to paint you this type of picture
when your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her
but another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her
wanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister
go figure, i ain't got a missus
they say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss
and the hall's shatterin, cause life is like a battlefield
and y'all battlin cause, you got you a rapper deal
so i guess you start feelin how those rappers feel
raw dog, hope she go and get that mornin after pill
but if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel
or your career gonna be pushin up daffodils
take care of yo' kid, go check your mistress
hit the lab and record, go handle your business
what type of life is this? so many different choices
too many different opinions, too many different voices
what am i afriad of, just to say love?
i love you baby but, this is what i'm made of
and i'ma be me, cause i can't be no other
so i don't know if aaliyah's gettin a little brother
but all i know is i already got one baby mother
and that's too much trouble, sorry i can't love you

[chorus: drake]
what am i afraid of?
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i don't have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say - you promised me you would never change
ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh
you promised me you would never change
ohh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)

[drake]
uhh, am i wrong for makin light of my situation? clap on
when 40 got some shit for me to snap on
now that i'm on i don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on
i'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home
and i'll be actin like i don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial, you'll see that i just called
some chick i met at the mall that i barely know at all
and, plus this woman that i messed with unprotected
textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it
the one that i'm layin next to just looked over and read it
man i couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, i'm holdin on by a thread it's
like i'm high right now, the guy right now
and you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now
that nothin really comes as a surprise right now
cause we just havin the time of our lives right now

[chorus]

[drake]
well alright, uhh
i live by some advices girl, lisa told me
the other day lisa told me that she miss the old me
uh, which made me question when i went missin
and when i start treatin my friends different
maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up
or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up
or the fact i haven't seen 'em since they locked big rich up
i know, but same time i'm quick to forget
i'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it all, burn it all, i'm startin it fresh
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed
did i just trade free time for camera time?
will i blow all of this money baby, hammer time?
yeah.. i just need some closure
ain't no turnin back for me, i'm in it 'til it's over


i feel good,
i got some time off,
girl it's been so long,
that you had fun cause i'ma need a cab just to get me home
and maybe you can call in sick,
and bring it to the crib and get all this dick
i know, i know i'm blunt but how real is that?
you want that feelin' back

[bun b - verse 1]
now when it come to making money i'm a printing press
when it come to being trill i'm a litmus test
i run it like a fitness test
and when it come to making history i'm like (?) son
a million ways to die you already chose one
a million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
we on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning
and while ya there let em know we did it just for them
i made them cough the cash up and left them just the phlegm
is that the king of the trill go tell em yes it's him
and his testosterone is up who's got the oestrogen
i like your girl and i think she like me even more
i hit her with that heave and ho and them i'm leaving bro
the dirty south's finest and dirty south's behind us
now thats a plus on the report card not a minus
keep your security blankets because i'm not your lighters
you got a problem with us you know its just as hard to find us

[drake - chorus]
uhhh, since your telling on me
tell the world bout me
ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
put it down, put it down
you know how i put it down, put it down
every time i come around
just bought a car, the n-gga pimp owned it
i threw some tints on it
he would have loved it
put it down, put it down
you know how i put it down, put it down

[bun b - verse 2]
they know i'm on a port arthur state of mind southern superstar status
i elevate the crime
my time is money so i put some money on my time
lightening on the breitling so exciting when you see that shine
we on that leather (?) before its never even thought of
i broke my bread and fed the team just like the holy father
i helped the blind to see and keep it g just like i oughta
the only thing thats left for us to do is walk on water
we playing all four quarters til the clock expire
so til i see the ref waving i will not retire
my flow is still official and i still got the fire
can't take your eyes off me, like when you watch the wire
and in '0-10 we finna go in
so let the opposition know there is no win
and i am no friend so put your hand down
tell em stand down before it's man down

[drake - chorus]
uhhh, since your telling on me
tell the world bout me
ask your girl about me, she probably tell you
put it down, put it down
you know how i put it down, put it down
every time i come around
just bought a car, the n-gga pimp owned it
i threw some tints on it
he would have loved it
put it down, put it down
you know how i put it down, put it down

[drake - verse 3]
i gotta hundred girls on each phone
drissy drake man, young sweet jones
i never cheat unless you count the girls i cheat on
i know you can't bring every single one you meet home
home sick just when i thought i was sick of home
losing track of time everyday we switching zones
drizzy hendrix i'm just backstage getting stoned
thank me later man, a million copies shipped and gone
overboard n-gga i'm quoting more n-gga
results are in i guess you should have voted more n-gga
swimming in the money y'all just float ashore n-gga
never drowning what the f-ck you think this boat is for n-gga
yeah i'm quick to take an rnb diva out
i'll bring some friends she'll bring some friends that know what we about
and when it's done i'll put some slippers on and see them out
and tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
i swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
but i'm just trying to keep it g for my chapter
listen to my words, see just what i mean
rest in peace to chad butler everyday i'm riding clean
ohhh

[drake - chorus]
uhhh, since your telling on me

[gucci mane]
i'm so f-cking dumb i wear diamonds on my thumbs,
there's a diamond on my d-ck so theres a diamond on her tongue,
i can't feel you baby cos i romantically numb,
emotionally drained i came here just so i can come,
theres nothing on the god son that i haven't done,
i got a lot of problems, getting p-ssy just isn't one,
girls are like buses every 15 mins they run,
man they like potato chips i just cant have one,
and i might like you for a minute,
but i dont like your friends in my business,
and i feel like you don't deserve a visit,
cos you aint in the kitchen when you want a whipping,

[drake - chorus]
uh, uh ahhhh,
i know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
i know you say you love me girrrrrrrrl,
problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
so we hear you talking boo but we just dont believe you,

uh, ok i'm all about it, all for it,
i'm all star team jordan, small forward,
i'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it,
no hesitation so i'm shooting if i draw for it,
how how (?) f-ck is up, now man i'm in this hoe,
life is moving fast, where the f-ck do all these minutes go,
mixtape dropped then i started getting 10 a show,
now i get a hundred what the f-ck you think i'm in it for,
young money forever, i bet gudda, jay and mack agree,
f-ck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me,
shout out to your girlfriend n-gga lately she distracting me,
wondering if i'm the best, well-i-am, no black eyed peas,
girls wanna f-ck your n-ggas, guy don't wanna be you,
lining up around the block so that they can get to see you,
i feel like i find a wife exactly when i need to,
so you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you,

[chorus]

[sean garrett]
ain't that your girl,
aint that your money,
aint you the same n-gga that say she want you that you funny,
aint you a gangsta, yeah funny,
you gave em funny, gave you to you, f-cking dummy,
classic line, b-tches run like buses,
gucci say n-ggas asking why, why you with my girl,
she let me get it n-gga,
she aint stupid, go turn up your radio,
i'm the next young lionel richie,
i gives a f-ck about doing a f-cking cameo,
we don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, no!
they just love us, they just love us, cos we stack them o's
cos we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
thats gon hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go

[drake]
uh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
i know you say you love me girrrrrrrrrrl,
problem is you prol tell that sh-t to everybody,
so we hear you talking boo but we just don't believe you!!!


[hook]
you know you know
you know you know

[verse 1]
uh, you know you know how the story goes,
you done jock my style, you done stole my flow,
you done seen me out, you gets no hello,
and you wonder why? man you know you know,
yeah and you should let them boys know too,
show them n-ggas every single thing i showed you,
im here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin i'm the man (big mike), so true,
yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
a place with wooden floors and space to put awards,
a couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,
the cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,
well i got it, i got it,
i wonder if id be happy without it, i doubt it,
i try not to really think about it,
i made it but i'm still playin like i'm bein scouted til i'm outted,
game top bitch, i hope youre proud of us,
king james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,
this old g got my whole suite cloudin up,
but i bet you i be out of time before i'm out of luck,
they aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
i really hate to say i told you so,
so i bite my tongue but you know you know,

[hook]

[verse 2]
uhh, please make your long story shorter,
this time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,
numbers do the talkin i have nothing for reporters,
i just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border,
yeah so you can spare me all the accolades,
im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,
half a million dollars later and my taxes paid,
and i'm still spendin money from my actin days,
damn, life is such a lovely thing,
feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,
tell your girlfriend that i can pull some f-ckin strings,
so were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,
yeah, i bet i be there i be there,
you see that '62 sittin outside? thats me there,
im jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,
putting in that overtime i never said it be fair,
im always left wishin i could have done it in person,
my apologies to all of the ones i was hurtin,
i got new girls but none of they love is for certain,
and call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,
damn what happened to us?
life can always change, you have to adjust,
how come when i got a party you stare at me in disgust?
if it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,
especially when i come flyin through the door
and kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,
why has every woman never dined her before?
am i the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
the rothschild's, the cru's, the 'caias and the opuses
its always nice when youre out with someone that notices,
my condo got that art gallery openness,
im just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is,
they aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
i really hate to say i told you so,
so i bite my tongue but you know you know

[chorus w/ lloyd ad libs]

[outro: lloyd]
get low, g-g-go girl [6x]
get low get low get low get low


uh, i am a distraction,
comin from my spot and i dont signal as i back in.
if cash is beautiful then money is attraction
then i should be a motherfuckin' centerfold of maxim.
open to my page and admire my desire,
frequent flyer i aspire to retire,
my boy stands alone if i'm with the chior,
got a cannon on my hip but nigga this is not mariah.
na, this the record killer for hire.
i eat and sleep with the weapon, the beat is all i require,
look i created despite the nigga that hated, every single bar gettin first forty-eighted
in the state of euphoria feelin so sedated.
the me and bitch the same were feel so related,
(?) in stated or denniscaded (?)
i put a thousand on it, i could prolly fuck the waitress.
so wait just take this,
one lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
white cup, orange pop tenneshee state shit
drop a four winning and then appreciate the greatness, nigga haha

yeah,
i wrote this verse sittin in my new car,
sometimes where you headed is too far,
it's more about where you are.
and i am, everywhere where you wish you could be
somebody somewhere just really understood me
yeah, i dream big, no false hope
my other niggas move keys, no off notes
but understand rich is a how were all ending up,
i'm at the label in the elevator,
send them up!


[chantal kreviazuk:]
how i'm feeling, it doesn't matter
cause you know i'm okay
instead, i ask myself, "why do you worry?"
when you know, you know i'm the same
i know, i know you don't love me, baby
they're trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[drake:]
i think i killed everybody in the game last year, man
fuck it, i was on though
and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
fuck it, i was wrong though
shout out to all my niggas living tax free
nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
oh well, i guess you lose some and win some
long as the outcome is income
you know i want it all and then some
shout out to asian girls, let the lights dim some
shots came, i don't know where they was sent from
probably some bad hoes i'm about to take the hint from
yeah, you know me well, nigga
i mean you ain't the only real nigga
they got me on these white women like seal, nigga
slave to the pussy but i'm just playing the field, nigga
are these people really discussing my career again?
asking if i'll be going platinum in a year again?
don't i got the shit the world wanna hear again?
don't michael jordan still got his hoop earring in?
man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
and i don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
and i be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
yeah...it's been that way from the beginning
i just been playing, i ain't even notice i was winning
and this is the only sound you should fear
man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[chantal kreviazuk:]
oh, i know, i know you don't love me, baby
they're trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[drake:]
you say i'm old news, well who the new star?
cause if i'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
used half of the money to beat my brother's case
red wine over fed time
and shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
and fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
you and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
don't make me break your kevin hart, boy
yeah.. it's whatever
you know, feeling good - living better
i think maybe i was numb to it last year
but you know i feel it now more than ever
my city love me like mac dre in the bay
second album, i'm back paving the way
the backpackers are back on the bandwagon
like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
and i met your baby moms last night
we took a picture together, i hope she frames it
and i was drinking at the palms last night
and ended up losing everything that i came with
feel like i've been here before, huh?
i still got 10 years to go, huh?
and this is the only sound you should fear
man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[chantal kreviazuk:]
oh, i know, i know you don't love me, baby
they're trying to take you away from me
only over my dead body

[outro:]
three in the morning still going down…


i can see it in your eyes, you're angry
regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
mad cause he ain't like me
oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
all the care i would take
all the love that we made
now you're trying to find somebody to replace what i gave to you
it's a shame you didn't keep it
alisha, catya, i know that you gon' hear this
i'm the man, yeah i said it
bitch, i'm the man, don't you forget it
the way you walk, that's me
the way you talk, that's me
the way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
and the voice in your speaker right now that's me
that's me, and the voice in your ear
that's me, can't you see
that i made it? yeah, i made it
first i made you who you are and then i made it
and you're wasted with your latest
yeah, i'm the reason why you always getting faded

take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
take a shot for me
a shot for me oooooo
a shot for me oooo

ok, look, i'm honest. girl, i can't lie, i miss you
you and the music were the only things that i'd commit to
i never cheated, for the record, back when i was with you
but you believed in everything but me, girl, i don't get you
she says "i know you changed
i never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
i really wish she had a different way of viewing things
i think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
it's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
and taint all the images of your "mr. perfect"
i could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
this is one i know you hated when you heard it
and it's worse because you know that i deserve it

take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
take a shot for me, oh oh oh oh
take a shot for me
a shot for me oooooo
a shot for me oooo

may your neighbors respect you
trouble neglect you
angels protect you
and heaven accept you


i might be too strung out on compliments
overdosed on confidence
started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
faded way too long i'm floating in and out of consciousness
and they sayin' i'm back, i'd agree with that
i just take my time with all this shit, i still believe in that
i had someone tell me i fell off, ooh i needed that
and they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd i leave it at
i know i exaggerated things, now i got it like that
tuck my napkin in my shirt, 'cause i'm just mobbin' like that
you know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
you gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
no, don't do it, (aye) please don't do it, (aye) 'cause one of us goes in
and we all go through it (aye)
and drizzy got the money, so drizzy gonna pay it

yeah, i be yelling out, "money over everything, money on my mind!"
then she wanna ask when it got so empty
tell her i apologize, happened over time
she says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
if they don't get it, they'll be over you
that new shit that you got is overdue
you better do what you supposed to do
i'm like "why i gotta be all that?" but still i can't deny the fact that it's true
listen to you expressing all them feelings
soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
and that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
i guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
you know that they ain't even got it like that.
you gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'cause i live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
when they get my shit and play it, i ain't even gotta say it, they know

they know, they know, they know

[rihanna]
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost

[drake – verse 1]
i've asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn't change
and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun? please don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours we both know
we know, they don't get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
'cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
big girls all get a little taste,ah
pushing me away so i give her space,ah
dealing with a heart that i didn't break
i'll be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don't know
trying to run from that, say you're done with that
on your face girl, it just don't show
when you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the party's over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won't ever have to worry,
you won't ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes
so look me in my eyes

[rihanna]
'cause if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost

[drake – verse 2]
yeah
it's my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can't deny that i want you, but i'll lie if i have to
'cause you don't say you love me
to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do (you do)
one time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
'cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
i've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
we know, you hate being alone
you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream
and they sold you one
you love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin' to save you
instead they say,
don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true

don't tell me, i don't care
if you hurt, i don't tell you
you don't care, if you're true

[rihanna]
i know you've been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here's what i'll do
i'll take care of you
i've loved and i've lost

but i've been drinking so much
that i'mma call her anyway and say,
"fuck that nigga that you love so bad.
i know you still think about the times we had."
i say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found.

i've been drinking so much
that i'mma call you anyway and say,

"fuck that nigga that you love so bad
i know you still think about the times we had."
i say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found.
and since you picked up i know he's not around."

(are you drunk right now?)

i'm just sayin', you could do better
tell me have you heard that lately
i'm just sayin' you could do better
and i'll start hatin' only if you make me

i think i'm addicted to naked pictures
and sitting talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
i don't think i'm conscious
of making monsters
outta the women i sponsor
'til it all goes bad
but shit it's all good
we threw a party, yeah we threw a party
bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
i was just calling 'cause they were just leaving
talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
i need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
too many drinks have been given to me
i got some women that's living off me
paid for their flights and hotels i'm ashamed
bet that you know them, i won't say no names
after a while girl they all seem the same
i've had sex four times this week, i'll explain
having a hard time adjusting to fame
sprite in that mixture, i've been talking crazy girl
i'm lucky that you picked up
lucky that you stayed on
i need someone to put this weight on

[drake and ericka lee on the phone:]
"well, i'm sorry."
"are you drunk right now?"

i'm just sayin' you could do better
tell me have you heard that lately
i'm just sayin' you could do better
and i'll start hatin' only if you make me

[drake on phone:]
"you're not gon' come?"
"guess i'm 'bout to just kick it here then…"

just throw up while i hold your hair back
her white friend said, "you niggas crazy."
i hope no-one heard that
i hope no-one heard that
'cause if they did, we gon' be in some trouble
if they did, we gon' be in some trouble, trouble


looking in the mirror i’m embarrassed
i’m feeling like a suicidal terrorist
react like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
i’m in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
i was dope when i said the music business was all i needed
when i got it i was greeted by an alien
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction
that'd keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my vice is similar women love when you’re my type
and you win it from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel, sin city
devil in a dress, platinum chanel
live the ambiance all cause the audience
one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse being read
i’ma go ‘n get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
capitalize that, and you weave look good
with the indian tracks
tracking device on your used 5 series
i don’t call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say we’re in the area cruisin’ in toronto
hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks, located where you can’t see us
a white waitress on standby when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up g
no doors all that nigga was missing was aaliyah
felt like the initiation
a reality living in the matrix
we talk casually about the industry
and how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin’
then he said that he was the same age as myself
and it didn’t help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo, the reason why i’m breathing on the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason was the highlight was when he said
you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
and bury yourself alive, then i died


[verse 1]
bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
can't even see straight, i can't even see straight
oh, fuck with me, i buy the shots
live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
but i'm the truth that's right i fucking said it
the living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
you girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
how'd i know, how'd i know? thats me on some psychic shit
i can tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts
but i might talk that real if you ask me what i care about
rappin', bitches, rappin', bitches bitches
and rappin' rappin' and bitches until all of it switches
i swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who i was
i'm the greatest man i said that before i knew i was
that's what's important and what really happened before this
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from new orleans
singing "walking like a man, finger on the trigger
i got money in my pocket, i'm a uptown nigga, ah"
with fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
i was pushing myself to get something that i deserve
that was back in the days, acura days
i was a cold dude, i'm getting back to my ways

[hook]
people always ask how i got my nice things
take my crown to the grave, i'm an underground king
i bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
cause i'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll
and i do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, (ugk fuck these other niggas)

[verse 2]
sometimes i need that romance, sometimes i need that pole dance
sometimes i need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
do me like the women from my town would
leather with that woodgrain, persian rugs on wood floors
talking all them good things, that's all i'm really good for
memphis tennessee no, see i start to go deep back
and ridgecrest with my seat back with yo gotti and e-mack
and these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
and they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south
and every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
so why am i in class if this is who i'm trying to be like
so i drop out, lessons i was taught are quick to fade
soon as i realized that turning papers in won't get me paid
and if i don't nothing i'ma ball
i'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall
yeah i need that, making major changes to the life i'm living
i had no choice, i had to prove i made the right decision
that was back in the days, acura days
i was a cold dude, i'm getting back to my ways

[hook]
people always ask how i got my nice things
take my crown to the grave, i'm an underground king
i bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
cause i'm down to spend whatever, lately i've been on a roll
and i do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it
nigga, do it for the city, (ugk fuck these other niggas)


[verse 1]
yeah, never thoughts of suicide, i'm too alive
but i still treat it likes it's do or die
even though dying isn't in the plans,
but neither was making it and here i am
in the presidential do you like your new room?
always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
since i saw aaliyah's precious life go too soon,
she deserve the credit for how i'm about to get it
that's why i got a new dumb thing moving through the street
got a new condo, move it to the beach
heard nicki just bought a brand new crib
goddamn man she's beauty and the beast (lord)
seems like yesterday that i was up and coming
still so young that i ain't had enough of nothing

the fam here, the drink here, the girls here?
well fuck let's get it then

[hook]
i'm trying to let go of the past
should we make this one a double?
you ain't even gotta ask, ah
because it's hard to say no, say no
yeah it's hard to say no

are you down, are you down? yea you all the way down, every time
am i down, am i down? yea i'm all the way down, we'll be fine
are you down, are you down? yea you all the way down, every time
am i down, am i down? yea i'm all the way down, we'll be fine

[verse 2]
used to make us proud we had dreams of getting bigger man
loved you until now, but now i'm the nigga man
you keep talking that "you was this and you had this
and you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it."
got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
and the line around the corner it's my motherfucking time
you should take it as a sign, man i got it right now.
i wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
let's be real about this shit, can i take you home?
or come to where you stay? do you live on your own?
i heard you got your ways, i never would have known
she said "you're such a dog" i said "you're such a bone."
i've been everywhere, where you know me from?
these days women give it to me like they owe me one
but they crave attention though they always saying "show me something."
but girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
at least i admit that, if you get that, and you with that
then fuck let's get it then

[hook]
i'm trying to let go of the past
should we make this one a double?
you ain't even gotta ask, ah
because it's hard to say no, say no
yeah it's hard to say no

are you down, are you down? yea you all the way down, every time
am i down, am i down? yea i'm all the way down, we'll be fine
are you down, are you down? yea you all the way down, every time
am i down, am i down? yea i'm all the way down, we'll be fine

don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
yeah, that's it, right there, that's it
do it just like that
only you could do it just like that
and i love it when your hair's still wet
'cause you just took a shower
running on a treadmill and only eating salad
sounds so smart, like you graduated college
like you went to yale, but you probably went to howard
knowing you, weekend in miami, tryna study by the pool
couple things due, but you always get it done
might have been a time when i loved her too
but you take that away, you always be the one
one, i wonder why the moon looks nice girl
maybe it's just right for the night
you said niggas coming on too strong girl
they want you in their life as a wife
that's why you wanna have no sex
why you wanna protest, why you wanna fight for your right
'cause you don't love them boys
pussy run everything, fuck that noise

i know things get hard
but girl you got it, girl you got it there you go
can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine,
when all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
it's just amazing, girl, and all i can say is...

[intro: rick ross]
all we wanted was opportunity
just blaze, lord knows!

[verse 1: drake]
it’s your worst nightmare, it’s my first night here
and this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
so i’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there, i don’t trust these hoes at all
but that’s just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple pornstars that i’m ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna are my only role models
heffer and jordan are my only role models
that’s why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
buy them sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
all of the little accents that make me a king
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
but it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
i’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about christmas in august
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs. fields they’re making the cookie stretch
i know it so well, i know the hustle so well
stunt like i’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel
drug money, outfit record clean
spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team
matchin’ rollies for real, matchin’ rovers for real
places they say they’ve been, we’ve actually going for real
i’m really killin’ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin’
i’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
mixtape legend, underground kings
lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch that’s living in palm springs
young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
they take the greats from the past and compare us
i wonder if they’d ever survive in this era
in a time where it’s recreation
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be pokin’ fun at
never the flow though, they know i run that
fuck you all, i claim that whenever
i change rap forever, the game back together, yup
ym, i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne that forever
i’m a descendent of either marley or hendrix
i haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
i’m hearing all of the jokes, i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean i’m a pussy
know that i don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows, lord knows, i’m heavy, i got my weight up
roll this and boost your rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me, then who should i be afraid of?
bought a white ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky
very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
in this bitch all drinks on the house like snoopy
that’s why all the real soldiers salute me
trill nigga, for real

[interlude: rick ross]
you know i love this
yolo, you only live once
i’m going so hard my nigga, i swear homie
everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

[verse 2: rick ross]
i fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
the hustle’s an art, i paint it what i would think
still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
destined for greatness, but got a place in jamaica
villa on the water with the wonderful views
only fat nigga in the sauna with jews
went and got a yacht, i’m talkin’ carnival cruise
and these niggas talkin like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
it’s the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
every by week, shit, i’m bound to buy a car
murder-cedes benz of that bubble double r
headlights flickin’, lookin’ like a fallin’ star
everyday them hammers bang, whippin' yay like anna mae
i run the game but the ladies think i’m running game
mink coats making women wanna fornicate
rosay and drake, i’m gettin’ cake, nothin’ short of great


word on road is the clique about to blow
you ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
we've been living on a high, they've been talking on a low
but it's cool, know you heard it all before

that's why i asked you how you mean, how you mean?
thought you knew about the team
that's why i asked you how you mean, how you mean?
thought you knew about the team

how you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
got you angry about this girl i'm with in all them magazines

baby she look like a star, but only on camera
only on camera, only on camera
it look like we in love, but only on camera
only on camera, only on camera

trying to tell you i'm the one, come and holla at me
before i'm on the next thing, ymcmb

ooh finally got you right here
(said i finally got my baby)

(tonight i'll ease your mind)
that's why i'm calling on you
(why i'm calling on you)

and ooh soft your loves desire
(soft your love)

(oh girl, you keep me calling on you)
(oh girl, you keep me calling on you)

how you mean, how you mean
thought you knew about the team
how you mean, how you mean
thought you knew about the team

how you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
you just know what you get told girl i see behind the scene
she spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
she been going way too hard, someone has to intervene

baby she look like a star, but only on camera
only on camera, only on camera
it might look like i care, but only on camera
only on camera, only on camera

don't listen to the lies, i swear they all lies
you know i could be your knight in shining armor all tires
girl they love me like i'm prince, like the new kid with the crown
bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down

ooh finally got you right here
(said i finally got my baby)
tonight i'll ease your mind
(tonight i'll ease your mind)
that's why i'm calling on you
(why i'm calling on you)

and ooh soft your loves desire
(soft your love)
it's hard to stay away
(stay away)
you keep me calling on you
(oh, girl you keep me calling on you)

how you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team
how you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team

just mail me my ring back, can't keep that shit


oh yeah

[verse 1]
summer's mine
i swear i said about a hundred times, i'ma need it back
i wish that you would come and find me
just to tell me that i haven't changed, girl i needed that from you
i'm getting money just taking care of me girl
i'm spending time just taking care of me right now
i'm getting money just taking care of me girl
cuz you'd be tired of taking care of me by now

[hook]
but the good ones go
the good ones go, if you wait too long
but the good ones go
the good ones go, if you wait too long
so you should go
you should go, before you stay too long

[verse 2]
don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
i know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
i shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
can't lose you, can't help it, i'm so sorry, i'm so selfish
uh, uh, i've been chilling in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
in case you starting to wonder why my new shit's sounding so h-town
but when it's all done baby i'm yours if you're still around
she knows, she knows, she knows

[hook]
but the good ones go
the good ones go, if you wait too long
but the good ones go
the good ones go, if you wait too long
so you should go
you should go, before you stay too long


[verse 1]
when a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
it's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
and she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
and it's all because she don't want things to change

[hook]
so cry if you need to, but i can't stay to watch you
that's the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to, but i can't stay to hold you
that's the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to, but i can't stay to hear you
that's the wrong thing to do
cause you'll say you love me, and i'll end up lying
and say i love you too

but i need someone different
you know it, oh ho, you know it
oh ho, you know it, we both know it
i need someone different
you know it, oh ho, you know it
oh ho, you know it, we both know it
something's been missing
you know it, oh ho, she knows it
oh ho, i know it, we all know it
i need someone different
(oh ho, oh ho)

[verse 2]
we live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
but we sure make it feel like we're together
cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[hook]
so cry if you need to, but i can't stay to watch you
that's the wrong thing to do
touch if you need to, but i can't stay to hold you
that's the wrong thing to do
talk if you need to, but i can't stay to hear you
that's the wrong thing to do
cause you'll say you love me, and i'll end up lying
and say i love you too

but i need someone different
you know it, oh ho, you know it
oh ho, you know it, we both know it
i need someone different
you know it, oh ho, you know it
oh ho, you know it, we both know it
something's been missing
you know it, oh ho, she knows it
oh ho, i know it, we all know it
i need someone different
(oh ho, oh ho)

[verse 1: drake]
people around you should really have nothing to say
me, i’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
and the weekends here started it right
even if you only get part of it right
live for today, plan for tomorrow
party tonight, party tonight
dying to meet your girlfriends
that you said you might bring
if they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

[bridge: drake]
houston girls, love the way it goes down
atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
vegas girls, love the way it goes down

[hook: drake]
but i gotta say, oh babe, oh babe, why is this so familiar?
just met, already feel like i know the real her
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time
we must’ve been here before, it’s still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
you must’ve done this before, this can’t be your first time

[verse 2: drake]
they keep telling me don’t save you
if i ignore all that advice
then something isn’t right
then who will i complain to?
but the weekends here started it right
even if i only get part of it right
live for today, plan for tomorrow
party tonight, party tonight
you got your guards up, i do too. there’s things we might discover
cause you got a past and i do too, we’re perfect for each other

[bridge + hook]

[verse 3: lil wayne]
cause to her i’m just a rapper, and soon she’ll have met another
so if tonight’s an accident, tomorrow we’ll recover
and i know i’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
i don’t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her, and she with it if i’m with it, and i’m with it
i know what makes her smile, but i won’t know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic? lipstick on the glass
i know this ain’t your first, but it’s better than your last.
tunechi

[verse 4: andre 3000]
shower her with dollar tips
shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name
you throw that ho a scholarship
all of them ain't all equipped
and this saddens me, i see the pecking order
quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married don't wanna go home
but we look up to them, they wish they were us
they want some new trim
we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind
cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in the boise state
can't see her play or the team, cuz
everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
and those who say they don't
souls will later on say to them "that ain't true"
all of them will have an opinion
but y'all know what you can do with them
but if you unsure, i'll take you on tour
to a place you can stick that in
well, sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele, i feel you baby
someone like you, more like someone unlike you
or something that's familiar maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell "girl that you're crazy!"
oh what the hell? nope can't be lazy
please be careful: bitches got the rabies


[drake:]
(gotta do what i gotta do, yeah)
all my exes live in texas like i'm george strait
or they go to georgia state where-
tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta
that she only see when she feels obligated
admitted it to me the first time we dated
but she was no angel, and we never waited
i took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
so we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
and we never talk too much after i blew up
just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
and i think i text her and told her i made it
and that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
and that's when i text her and told her i love it
then right after texted and told her i'm faded
she asked
what have i learned since getting richer
i learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
i learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
even though it's fucked up, girl, i'm still fucking with ya
damn, is it the fall
time for me to revisit the past
it's women to call
there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
there's stories to tell, we been through it all
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
like:

[bridge - lil wayne:]
do you love this shit?
are you high right now?
do you ever get nervous?
are you single?
i heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
you getting money? you think them niggas you with is wit' you?

and i say
hell yeah
hell yeah, hell yeah
fuckin' right
fuckin' right, all right
(and we say) hell yeah
hell yeah, hell yeah
fuckin' right
fuckin' right, all right

[lil wayne:]
so much for being optimistic
they say love is in the air, so i
hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
keep a few bad bitches in my circle
my nuts hang like ain't no curfew
bitch if you wave, then i will surf you
i flew jet, she flew commercial
but we still met, later that night
after my session, she came over
i was aggressive, and she was sober
i gave her pills
she started confessing and started undressing
and ask me to hold her
and so i did, but that was last month
and now she's texting me, asking for closure
damn
she say this shit gon' catch up to me
i keep tissue paper
we eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
she say she hate that she love me
and she wish i was average
shit, sometimes i wish the same
and i wish she wasn't married
promises, i hope i never break 'em
met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[bridge]
do you love this shit?
are you high right now?
do you ever get nervous?
are you single?
i heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
you getting money? you think them niggas you with is wit' you?

[hook]
(and i say) hell yeah

(and we say) hell yeah
hell yeah, hell yeah
fuckin' right
damn right, all right
awww... yeah


it's like '09 in your basement and i'm in love with nebby
and i still love her but it fell through because i wasn't ready
and your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
and i sit next to you, and i lecture you because those are deadly
and then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
and you tell me i'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
now it's "fuck you, i hate you, i'll move out in a heartbeat"
and i leave out and you call me, and you tell me that you're sorry
you love me, and i love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
and it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
i see painkillers on the kitchen counter, i hate to see it all hurt so bad
but maybe i wouldn't have worked this hard
if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
uh, maybe i should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
'cause leave it up to me, j, and neeks, we'll probably end up robbing a bank
then wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
gets me a flight to houston in the morning
oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
he's thinking of signing me, i come home
we make a mixtape with seventeen songs
and almost get a grammy off of that thing
they love your son man that boy gone
you get the operation you dreamed of
and i finally send you to rome
i get to make good on my promise
it all worked out girl, we shoulda known
'cause you deserve it

is this shit real, should i pinch you?
after all the things that we been through, i got you
look what you've done, look what you've done
look what you've done for me now
you knew that i was gonna be some
when you stressed out, and you need some, i got you
look what you've done, look what you've done

it's like '06 in your backyard and i'm in love with jade
and i'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real, it's when it doesn't fade
and my father living in memphis now he can't come this way
over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black american dad story
know that i'm your sister's kid but
that still don't explain the love that you have for me
i remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
damn your house felt like the hamptons
for all of my summer romances
i never really had no one like you man this all new shit
made the world i know bigger, changed the way that i viewed it
had all this fighting going on at the crib
you'd calm me down when i lose it
told you i think i'm done acting, now i'm more in touch with the music
you said either way i'll be a star, i could go so far
talked to me, you got to me
then you tossed the keys and loaned me your car
yeah, just a young kid in a drop-top lexus
hopin' that i don't get arrested
just another kid that's goin' through life
so worried that i won't be accepted
but i could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
you took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
checks bounce but we bounce back
i put all the money in your accounts back
and i thank you, i don't know where i'd really be without that,
it worked out man, you deserve it

is this shit real, should i pinch you?
after all the things that we been through, i got you
look what you've done, look what you've done
look what you've done for me now
you knew that i was gonna be some
when you stressed out, and you need some, i got you
look what you've done, look what you've done

[drake's grandmother:]

[intro]
i hate when people say they feel me man, i hate that shit.
it’ll be a long time before yall feel me, if ever

[verse 1]
you won’t feel me til everybody say they love you, but it’s not love
and your suit is oxblood and your girl fuckin’ hates you and your friends faded off shots of
what you ordered than forget about the game you on top of
your famous girlfriend ass gettin’ thicker than the plot does
and when you forget it, thats when she pop up
and you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
i get 3 suv’s for niggas dressed like refugees
and deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
and you do dinners at french laundry and napa valley
scallops and glasses of dolce, that shit right up your alley
you see a girl and you ask about her
bitches smiling at ya, it must be happy hour
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
it’s feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now
walking through airport security with your hat down
‘stead of gettin’ a pat down, they just keep on saying that they feel ya nigga

yeah,
it’s been too long
been way too long

[hook - the weeknd]
i’m faded too long, oooh
still i’m faded too long, ooooh
still i’ve been faded too long
i been faded too long
the ride

[verse 2]
you wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself you’re in it
and tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
and steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
and ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
you need a minute, you got it
you know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
the sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
when you record with 2 others that want the same things
yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
and so you up there every night you swear you getting close
that champagne money was for gas and phone bills
but shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
you drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga
and come out every night to let the city see the nigga
telling stories that nobody relate to
and even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya nigga

[hook - the weeknd]

[verse 3]
i haven’t been inside terminal 1 and 3 in so long
i’m driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
that runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
and all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
performance out the years, got you asking whats good at home
whats good at home?
the same hoes are still at it, i shoulda known
my young niggas poppin’ m’s and sippin’ dirty jones
problem children that all be reppin’ octobers own
brand new girl, and she still growing
brand new titties, stitches still showing
yeah and she just praying that it heals good
i’m bout to fuck and i’m just praying that it feels good
i really don’t know much but shit i know a secret
they say more money more problems, my nigga don’t believe it
i mean sure there’s some bills and taxes i’m still evading
but i blew 6 million on my self and i feel amazing
young money maker, season ticket holder
season switching over
i come through them bitches still scorching as if i didn’t notice
you niggas gettin’ older, i see no threat in yoda
i’m out here messing over the lives of these niggas
that couldn’t fuck with my freshman flow
look at that fucking chip on your nephews shoulder
my sophomore they was all for it, they all saw it
my juniors and senior will only get meaner
take care nigga

[hook]


she says "kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
and when you're fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin mary
i just tell her to spare me
i was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
it's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
i hate that ho, i make it so hard just to talk, don't i?
i get off topic don't i? i get it poppin' don't i?
i'll end up stopping won't i? and by the time i end up stopping
you'll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don't lie
she's losing it right now, cause if i wasn't who i am, she would've been moving in by now
but instead we're moving slow -- i guess she's used to it by now
and she gives me all her trust and i'm abusing it right now
but this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
you just told me i ain't shit and i guess i'm proving it right now

i'd rather be with you, but you are not around
so i'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
cause i hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone
half the time we don't end up fucking, i don't ask her for nothing
you leave me in the morning, i don't see her for months
but i just hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone
so she's here and we're both so gone

hotel to hotel, girl - i could use your company
full name and birthday, i book a flight, you come to me
but she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
if she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
you say that you over me you always end up under me
you know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
don't start with yo shit - i put you back in your place
she tells me "i bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
and hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
like i don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
and whoever i be with, they got nothing on you
that's just something to do when there's nothing to do
yeah, but she's losing it right now
she has choices she should make i think she's choosing it right now
one more chance to make it right, i think i'm using it right now
you just said i never learn i guess i'm proving it right now

i'd rather be with you, but you are not around
so i'mma call somebody up and see if they be down
cause i hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone
half the time we don't end up fucking, i don't ask her for nothing
you leave me in the morning, i don't see her for months
but i just hate sleeping alone, i hate sleeping alone
so she's here and we're both so gone

[verse 1]
comin' off the last record, i'm gettin' 20 million off the record
just to off these records, nigga that's a record
i'm livin' like i'm out here on my last adventure
past the present when you have to mention
this is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
cause it's that new drizzy drake, that's just the way it go
heavy airplay all day with no chorus
we keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
i reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
i reached heights that dwight howard couldn't reach, nigga
prince akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
i could go a hour on this beat, nigga
i'm just as famous as my mentor
but that's still the boss, don't get sent for
get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
hot temper, scary outcome
here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
that always let they mouth run
bench players talkin' like starters, i hate it
started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
yeah, tom ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
degenerates, but even ellen love our shit
rich enough that i don't have to tell 'em that i'm rich
self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[verse 2]
sittin' gucci row like they say up at unlv
young rebel, young money nothin' you could tell me
paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
i'll compromise if i have to, i gotta stay with the family
not even talkin' to nicki, communication is breakin'
i dropped the ball on some personal shit, i need to embrace it
i'm honest, i make mistakes, i'd be the second to admit it
think that's why i need her in my life, to check me when i'm trippin'
on a mission tryna shift the culture
tell me who dissin', i got some things that'll hit the culprit
them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
all of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
fuck what you think, i'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
that shit i heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
like aye, b i got your cd, you get an e for effort
i piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
i don't change like credentials, you know you see the necklace
my life's a completed checklist
i'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
that's real

[verse 3]
how much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
lately i've been feelin' like guy pearce in memento
i just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
the family all that matters, i'm just out here with my kinfolk
off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
this for shorty up on glengrove who love when i catch my tempo
i sip the pora and listen to cappadonna
the fresh prince just had dinner with tatiana, no lie
all these 90's fantasies on my mind
the difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
i might come through without security to check if you're fine
that's just me on my solo like fuck it, like yolo
wanted to tell you, "accept yourself"
you don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
and if you end up needing some extra help, then i can help
you know, back on your feet and shit
tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
how much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
how this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
life is soundin' crazy, 40 on martin scorcese
and i wouldn't change a thing if you payed me, now real nigga wassup


somewhere between psychotic and iconic
somewhere between "i want it" and "i got it"
somewhere between i'm sober and i'm lifted
somewhere between a mistress and commitment

but i stay down, girl, i always stay down
get down, never lay down
promise to break everybody off before i break down
everyone just wait now
so much on my plate now
people i believed in: they don't even show their face now

what they got to say now?
nothing they can say now
nothing really changed but still they look at me a way now
what more can i say now?
what more can i say now?
you might feel like nothing was the same

just too busy running shit to run home to you
you know that paper my passion
bittersweet celebrations
i know i can't change what happened

i can't help it
i can't help it
i was young and i was selfish
i made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's

now you hate me
stop pretending, stop that fronting
i can't take it
girl, don't treat me like a stranger
girl, you know i seen you naked

girl, you know that i remember

and you might feel like nothing was the same

i still been drinking on the low
mobbin' on the low
fuckin' on the low

scheming on the low
the furthest thing from perfect like everyone i know

i just been drinkin' on the low

drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting, scheming
plotting, scheming, getting money

this the life for me
my mama told me this was right for me
i got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
i should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me

your actions make us doubt you
your lack of effort got me rapping different
this the shit i wanna go out to
play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slipping

naked women swimming: that's just how i'm living
donate a million to some children: that's just how i'm feeling
a nigga filling up arenas. who the fuck can see us?
i had to derrick-rose the knee up
before i got the re-up

yours truly, the boy
i just build and build more
y'all niggas build to destroy
y'all niggas party too much
man, i just chill and record
no filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

yes, lord, this the shit i wanna go out to
this the shit i wanna go out to

story stayed the same through the money and the fame

i just love when i'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
we used to be friends, girl, and even back then
you would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that
well, made me think about the game, girl
and how i switched it up with a new thang
young nigga came through on his wu-tang
and nowadays when i ask about who got it, they say it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
it's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure [x2]

how you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
if you nervous, hit the lights, i know we only fucking out of spite
cause your man don't do you right, do you right
i could fuck you so good then i hit you with the 9am in dallas who you like
baby who you like

[verse:]
machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
i just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
it's about who did it right, niggas looking like "preach"
open cases on me for a half a million each
i find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets
i know, luckily i didn't have to grow there
i would only go there cause there's niggas that i know there
i don't know what's getting into me
i just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
and you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
people like mazin who was a best friend to me
start to become a distant memory
things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
and fucking with me mentally, i think it's meant to be
paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
but you gotta understand when it's yours
they don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice
